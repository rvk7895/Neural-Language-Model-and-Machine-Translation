49.392521925038764
when used preventively, it saves the state and the economy a great deal of money.	20.854995710626163
i have completely failed to understand in this debate why a reasonable set of rules was not adopted back in 1993, especially as the commission and parliament did not want any derogations even then.	78.4371475083398
seven million workers were affected and specific sectors, such as the mobile worker sector, have been subject to ruinous competition over recent years, especially in germany.	68.3104264512208
it is therefore also a social problem and it is not enough, mr crowley, to use tachographs or other technical aids.	23.163682500117616
one does not exclude the other.	9.060802075427686
we also need a framework directive, because the employees who are affected have been working in a grey zone for a long time now.	44.26414213816419
they had no rules, they were not covered by a collective agreement, they were exploited and some also engaged in self-exploitation.	49.773152017396214
we know that this overload sometimes gave rise to alcohol-related problems.	16.497696818461872
parliament has shown sufficient flexibility; mrs smet highlighted our legislative maturity.	21.734401881850562
i think, mrs smet, you have proven that we can also fight.	9.297895313641728
the results are acceptable.	1.1401813541291
i am trying to muster support, even if we have not achieved everything we wanted to.	23.002326847957654
but the transition period and the graduated plan are the maximum we have allowed the council.	25.915695736312113
i hope that no government will use up the full period of time and am counting on constructive competition between the member states to see which state will be the first to implement the proposals from parliament and the commission.	51.34829028773193
directive 93/104 was already very restrictive as far as worker production is concerned.	28.830359915706005
it does not harmonise social legislation upwards, quite the opposite.	32.596865731468505
it establishes a european framework which falls a long way short of workers' expectations: an 11-hour daily rest period, a 48-hour working week, a 24-hour weekly break.	109.75342726809087
what is more, a number of categories were excluded from its field of competence.	15.422192623766712
we find the compromise, which parliament is to vote on today following the meetings of the conciliation committee, unsatisfactory in terms of both the health and the safety of workers.	58.8546306765977
it makes flexibility more widespread, particularly for sea fishermen, establishing the systematic annualisation of reference periods.	60.19785607448021
it will permit further exemptions to the already excessive legislation of 48 hours per week.	132.37915607921798
finally, it will take nine years, in the best possible case, for the working week of doctors in training to be reduced from 58 hours to 48.	55.83549360938756
in fact, the proposed working time organisation institutes social deregulation at the very time when, in france, doctors in training are campaigning for decent working conditions and genuine safety for service-users.	104.73706303836985
proper organisation of working time would entail, we reiterate, a real reduction in working hours accompanied by moves to create a sufficient number of jobs.	63.69186106561081
we cannot support this report as it stands.	4.50847319620187
mr president, this proposal will bring an additional seven million workers in europe under the protection of the working time directive, allowing them to have reasonable working conditions and proper rest periods.	69.8363491197735
however, to get a 48-hour week, junior doctors must wait nine years minimum and possibly twelve years.	61.09323348592913
i will not pretend to be happy with this situation.	13.09619256940449
it is, however, the best that we could achieve if we were to end once and for all the council's delaying tactics.	31.32769834704297
it has been obvious since 1993 that those excluded from the directive at that time would eventually come under its protection.	67.17806738291436
one has to ask, therefore, why over that seven-year period virtually nothing was done in ireland or in britain to bring the number of doctors forward that would be needed to implement it.	103.67331374027037
in ireland some junior doctors work over 100 hours per week, the average being 70 to 80.	76.4179386174125
only last night they suspended strike action which they had threatened because they have now reached an interim agreement which will ensure that they are actually paid for the overtime they work.	109.91750400939068
in some cases they were not paid at all, in some cases only half the normal rate.	51.218526405803935
some progress has been made and no doubt the conclusion of the conciliation has helped them in that regard.	26.823311365393298
through the council of ministers both britain and ireland fought tooth-and-nail to slow the process down.	84.08461291084372
that was unfortunate.	0.22261636205615254
the working arrangements for junior doctors are like a horror story from a dickensian novel of the nineteenth century.	34.551737354970975
i find it bizarre that at the beginning of the 21st century we are still arguing for common sense with regard to health and safety.	22.511631436306676
i would appeal to all national governments, including ireland, not to utilise the additional provisions for extending the implementation of this directive beyond the nine-year period and would remind them that it is intended only as an exceptional measure if all other genuine steps have been taken to implement the measures here.	83.8819759702355
mr president, the proposed working time directive for specific categories of worker such as doctors in training, offshore workers or mobile workers, is typical of the slow and derisory nature of social europe.	161.3321581009274
the recitals of the proposal, nonetheless, stress the specific importance of this file, the first major file on social issues, adding, even, that it is a matter of the health and safety of 7 million workers.	49.12346509125062
in france, for example, a number of strikes by junior doctors recently drew the attention of public opinion to the intolerable length of the working day for this category of worker, harmful to the doctors in training themselves, but also to the quality of the care they are providing their patients with.	99.29005452972834
the same question arises, with at least as much urgency, for other categories such as offshore workers or transport workers.	51.686005979651306
what we should have had was a quick decision and an appropriate reduction in working hours.	27.256582009692156
well, the proposal does intend to cut hours, but by phasing in the cuts.	79.45673008164398
for the first three years, 58-hour working weeks are permitted.	18.538378037900202
we have to wait 5 years for the maximum working week to be reduced to 48 hours, and the commission is cynical enough to cite technical reasons in order to grant a further 2-year delay in application.	77.67418884649646
who are they trying to kid that these measures could not come into force almost immediately if there was any political will to act in favour of the interests of the workers concerned rather than favouring the claims of management?	42.006567279710495
some restriction, even a derisory cut, in working hours is better than no restriction at all.	54.97095927407033
we shall not vote against this text, but we shall conclude from this experience that workers can have no expectations of social europe and that, decidedly, nothing can replace the collective strength of the workers when it comes to amending legislation in favour of the workers.	73.69839848525247
mr president, the chairman of the european parliament' s committee on employment and social affairs could not remain silent in this debate.	15.23801599293749
thank heavens, my fellow members have already said what needed to be said about the issue itself.	20.73779172134575
i shall come back to this point.	4.28878801955794
we are not terribly proud of the final result, but i should at least like to pay tribute to it, as some outcome had to be found.	53.25689526313504
at this point, i should like to thank mrs smet, our efficient and indefatigable rapporteur, and mr provan, who was also the persistent and efficient chairman of our conciliation committees.	51.12421842242149
i should like to thank all our coordinators, mr brok, mr hughes, mrs flautre, mr schmid, mrs lynne, who demonstrated great understanding in order to reach some sort of outcome.	36.29741135271227
i should like to pay tribute to the commission. without wishing to embarrass you, mrs diamantopoulou, throughout almost all this debate parliament has had the technical and even political support of the commission, particularly on the important amendments.	59.75791319174617
i have one small correction to make, unless i misunderstood, to what mrs smet has just said. it is not exactly the first successful conciliation on social matters between the european parliament and the council.	53.546265141320724
it is the second, following the successful conciliation on the minor issue of workers working in an explosive atmosphere.	71.67167846121774
this is, however, an infinitely more wide-ranging issue, of course.	17.992436071116895
mr president, i must point out how unusually tough the council is to deal with.	18.30955712580562
the political truth is that the parliament team, in an astounding spirit of responsibility and unanimity - and you have witnessed the benign respect which i and mr bushill-matthews, for example, have for each other - was remarkable for its united front as much as for its determination to succeed.	64.72255229463734
parliament made most of the running.	0.5635747560431676
we are not proud of the result in terms of the content.	11.026765502639755
in a real democracy parliament would have been determining the legislation.	17.917093574741184
i would like to remind the council that we are just as dedicated to achieving results, but that they must not expect parliament to make quite so many concessions on a regular basis.	64.61062380237514
mr president, i would like first of all to make three political comments.	16.29242923977811
i feel that the successful outcome of the conciliation procedure proves that where there is a will, there is a way.	33.88704644239732
in order for this conciliation to succeed, we had to take account of the fifteen different systems in the member states, different fields of work and proposals from various employer and employee federations.	94.01172367493336
we also had to take account of the viability of health services as things now stand and competitiveness in sectors such as transport and fisheries.	37.480174007447424
this was no mean feat!	3.3124789857003796
it has taken six years to achieve today' s result and it is the first major conciliation decision in the social sphere - and i say major because it affects some 5 million workers.	81.77563975465542
i feel that the most interesting point - and this is my third comment - is the number of workers affected by this directive, who are at present excluded from the working time directive and who will enjoy these rights once this directive is applied.	69.09820660036426
in my view, therefore, we should be satisfied regardless of whether or not this directive meets all our requirements.	50.28453911923438
the upshot is that the provisions of the working directive will apply to doctors in training, workers at sea, rail workers and all non-mobile workers in excluded sectors.	87.6205695389357
i would like in particular to thank the chairman of the committee, mr rocard, the vice-chairman, mr provan, who used his great experience to guide the conciliation procedure, and of course, mrs smet who, with her wealth of ministerial experience, helped achieve such a difficult conciliation.	115.15759065149358
i would also like to give special thanks to the portuguese presidency and the member states, particularly those which, for reasons we cannot go into right now, have experienced major problems with their national health services, such as great britain, spain and ireland.	63.23379716134042
certain speakers raised the issue of the implementation of the directive.	5.828323544213092
i should like to stress that it is indeed a particularly important issue.	7.247467272408878
one of the commission' s fundamental duties is to monitor the implementation of directives.	21.229669103776104
here i should like to ask the meps to cooperate with us and closely monitor any underhanded plans in member states, so that the commission can intervene immediately.	32.68684757500929
a further two questions have also been raised, the first by messrs hughes, schmid and pronk as to what we intend to do in the road and rail transport sectors.	39.93671399612003
first, i must tell you that the transport council is involved, making the whole process even more complicated.	18.203437396282933
secondly, as for road transport, the commission tabled a proposal in 1996, but it was blocked by the council in 1998.	53.52665541305449
the commission intends, with the cooperation of the french presidency, to re-table the issue.	15.016563505555396
we are awaiting new negotiations by the social partners and we hope to obtain their assent.	26.29358282648218
if we cannot proceed in this way, we shall have to change the whole approach we have adopted so far.	17.14102447735851
with regard to the issue of fisheries, the matter was raised once again by mr hudghton.	16.11333364043107
we have discussed this in the past.	1.4552721572337433
i will try to clarify it.	1.4374019089022063
i am afraid i was not clear enough.	11.52353338606319
so i would like to repeat that the issue of self-employment in fisheries is not included in this directive.	9.38095317296082
the self-employed in fisheries is a matter of national competence.	14.049549450130714
that is very clear and very precise.	5.548124153782297
i thank you very much for all your support and help during these discussions, and that of your services.	40.06407894310079
it is very much appreciated indeed.	5.934486582406783
the debate is closed.	2.0088465528071904
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	3.9767185670354483
reviewing aid to third countries	5.2543547374086765
the next item is the commission communication - reviewing aid to third countries.	19.870785060796248
mr president, i hope parliament will excuse me if shortly after making a brief presentation i have to leave, but this is, as parliament knows, very much the collective work of the relex commissioners as a whole and very much the shared work of my colleague, commissioner nielson and myself.	94.22745459450957
commissioner nielson will still be here to make his own contribution to this report and to answer any questions which may arise.	29.713839096664714
the function i have to attend is a joint meeting of two committees which was specially arranged to discuss a number of external assistance issues so i hope parliament will be understanding.	73.41720799010022
i think it is fair to say that the proposals that we have put forward go right to the heart of the issues that are raised in the white paper on reform and it is extremely important for us to demonstrate that the reform of our external assistance programmes is the flagship or one of the flagships, for an overall reform process.	28.52817703521586
people occasionally get a little bored when one talks about internal procedures but what they should recognise is what we are discussing in these particular proposals: ways in which, first of all, we can get assistance to people more rapidly and effectively and, secondly, ways in which we can change the image of the european union around the world.	67.33327859616965
all of us have, alas, experienced too frequently occasions when instead of us getting the credit for what we are trying to do on behalf of europe's taxpayers, we get blamed for not doing it a lot more effectively and a lot more rapidly.	125.01772697451362
i hope that is a problem which we will be able to tackle.	6.538304782312896
very briefly, it is worth reminding ourselves what the background to this issue is.	24.628467285832237
we have seen a threefold increase in external assistance commitments managed by the scr over the last 10 years.	46.82558878488874
that has been driven by events and by political pressures; a recognition of the responsibilities we should discharge in central and eastern europe - the recognition which that triggered of our responsibilities in the mediterranean.	75.56145063504493
it is worth noting that our assistance programmes in the mediterranean have increased four and a half times since 1990.	60.818439446194205
then there is the balkans crisis where the attempts to put in place a common foreign and security policy are being particularly tested.	22.64569120381806
while our external assistance programmes themselves have grown very rapidly, staff resources have failed to keep pace.	54.101165924869335
the commission has 2.9 staff for every eur 10 million that we manage.	32.09861784075365
that compares with an average figure about twice that for member states - the figure is 5.7 but it goes as high as 9 for some member states and 4.2 for the world bank.	89.11345638617732
one of the consequences of that has been the increasing use of technical assistance offices which has been much criticised by parliament and by the court of auditors on the grounds of weak monitoring and a lack of political control.	38.29554362097447
it is worth noting that we have spent about eur 170 million a year on the 80 technical assistance offices which is equivalent to the cost of 800 staff working for the commission.	71.16428576478467
a consequence of all this is that the scr today has over eur 21 billion in outstanding commitments awaiting payments.	126.73787389290966
that is an embarrassingly large figure.	2.425779881246412
i do not blame the staff of the scr who work extremely hard in very difficult circumstances, but there are not enough of them.	61.051854574936925
they have had to operate with extremely difficult procedures.	14.224660041126546
they have also had to operate against a background of member states second, third and fourth guessing every implementation decision that we try to make.	73.73098382319905
we have brought forward in the document, which has now been made public, our proposals for dealing with this problem.	22.012853349432653
as honourable members will know, over the years parliament has put forward a number of proposals including the idea that we should externalise the management of our overseas aid.	36.15641874957377
that remains a possibility for the long term though it would take some time because one would first have to get in place the necessary legal framework.	47.16295069595506
however my principal concern at the moment is not how we get from a to z - that often seems rather easier than getting from a to b. what we have to do - whatever the long term objective may be is - to find better ways of managing our external assistance straightaway.	108.69856546541234
we have put forward a number of proposals. we have put forward proposals for improving programming: making sure that all the relex commissioners share responsibility for programming - we have suggested the reuniting of the project cycle from identification to implementation - we think the present split has not worked well.	141.9013961391096
what we propose to do is to create a new implementation body replacing the scr which we think should be called europe aid.	63.81056098489954
it would be initially an office under a board made up of all the external relations commissioners though, as i say, the option of moving to externalisation in the longer term remains on the table.	140.17544214672859
we want to devolve more responsibility to delegations and, where possible, to national authorities in the field.	38.71964146161425
we have proposed special treatment for the pre-accession strategy: humanitarian assistance and macro-financial assistance with fully integrated management.	68.58465502560023
that means, for example, transferring the residual scr functions for phare to the directorate-general for enlargement.	30.161979559380864
we have proposed taking urgent measures to tackle the backlog of old and dormant projects.	22.617871592176368
we are writing to the relevant chairmen of parliamentary committees and to the court of auditors to explain our approach.	30.169655174151593
i do not want to go on for very much longer, except to say this: where will the resources come from to manage and run our programmes in the proposed office, europe aid, rather better in the future than we have managed in the past?	107.53941271390238
we have to take our turn with others in the commission in arguing our corner in the peer group process for the assistance we think is required to manage our programmes effectively.	70.39156424680101
we may, as a result, present the budgetary authority with a rectifying letter to the 2001 budget proposals in september.	47.11370108323857
that is for the future.	3.3204605026153797
the simple point i want to make is this: we cannot go on as we have.	22.4531902596562
in my judgement it is simply not an option.	12.416907389977142
we have to do better.	9.97781688466689
we are not bidding for a bigger empire.	9.679367245755431
the budgetary authority will ultimately have to judge the right scale of european union external aid programmes.	33.49468703598322
however, my only aim is to put the commission in a position where it can run these programmes competently.	31.75026741427879
i have to say very bluntly to parliament that there are two possibilities: either the budgetary authority agrees with our ideas and will then try to implement them from 2001, or else, in order to manage what our programmes amount to more competently, we will be obliged to propose very large cuts.	75.0593088386364
we cannot go on in a situation in which we are not prepared to provide the resources to manage effectively the money that is voted by the budgetary authority for our external assistance programmes.	39.66384197972108
we have to be prepared to face up to the management and administrative consequences of what we are trying to do around the world, otherwise the people who suffer are those who should be receiving our help to enable them to read and write or live a better and healthier life or create the institutions of good governance in their communities.	80.23386462172108
they are the people who suffer as well as the european union's reputation.	12.079445428899602
i am sure this will be a long debate.	8.541259836916096
i am sure that parliament will have a considerable contribution to make to the discussion over the next few months.	16.00617459193107
however, my impression after a few months in this job is that parliament wants as badly as the commission to deliver a more competently run assistance programme all around the world.	98.4415154407904
mr president, this is refreshing - the fact that the european union is acknowledging that there are problems but that we have solutions.	13.143571751713274
commissioner nielson will recall that a couple of months ago i suggested that it might be the case that he could become an emperor without clothes.	26.916220421485413
is it not the case now that this proposal, taking away so much from dg development as it does, is likely to make my prediction come true?	84.6220048729281
secondly, at the end of what commissioner patten was saying, i think he reiterated what he was quoted as saying in "the times" this morning where he said that member states should back his plans with resources or cut aid.	112.19778725842038
i have to say, commissioners, that i find this a deeply worrying and dangerous statement and likely to be taken at its face value by member states and not in the way that you suggest.	76.30807974682462
i would very much appreciate clarification of those two questions by one or other commissioner.	43.08758499158766
mr president, i do not feel like an emperor without clothes, but you can judge for yourself.	20.185543476942076
the situation is that we had to do something not just to integrate the project cycle in terms of the line management of activities.	34.68513151858518
we also had to do something concerning squaring the circle organisationally giving substance to my political overall responsibility for development policy.	64.03651656518026
we have done this without changing the portfolios that were defined.	19.047643234134206
the solution we have reached is to create a board of directors which will oversee and politically be the managerial part of running the new office or europeaid or whatever scr is going to be called.	61.95465722027107
my role on that board will be that of the chief executive officer.	55.3629184570484
commissioner patten will be chairman, reflecting the position he already has at the head of the table being the ultimate coordinator of all relex commissioners' activities.	84.62359944211396
we are in a sense structuring the political roles that have been defined and we are doing it in such a way that i think it really does have a chance of functioning.	42.012306684856306
there are two elements in this which will contribute to better coherence and better political consistency.	22.816829249110715
one is what i have already mentioned with a closer political involvement in the management of the actual implementation.	21.233169182226167
the other one is the quality-support group which will have its secretariat in dg development.	48.37074877671647
the role is to make sure that the formulation of the different programmes, including those in dg relex, is consistent with the policy and principles that we have defined.	39.05899161740509
all in all, i think this is a good attempt at doing things given the way things were defined last july.	47.247598713517334
this will also concentrate a lot of attention among all relex commissioners on the problem of whether or not we actually are delivering.	32.42898306166527
we have to get out of the culture of commitment and into the culture of delivering.	18.511939049603118
what we are doing here will be part of that change.	14.572588399603099
we also talk about ownership in our partner countries as being a major problem.	37.416955093271405
the reality, because of the way we are organised in the commission, is that ownership on our side is extremely vague and problematic.	39.50744093932381
this is going to change as a consequence of the reform we are putting forward now.	15.256281250114643
finally, i will address the issue of the risk of what happens if we do not get the staff and the resources to do the job.	22.59652599485002
clearly continuing the way things are now is not acceptable, it is not possible.	16.17765169673784
we have to make the point as clearly as commissioner patten just did which means that we want those resources.	42.78050851108751
we have commitments, we have an agreement with 71 acp states, we have the member states backing that and accepting the next ninth european development fund.	98.3725289028052
all this is part of the promises we have made already, so there is really no alternative to getting the people to do the job.	41.082030460184605
but how to do it - this is a problem we cannot solve alone, which is why we are appealing as strongly and clearly as we are; and we make no secret of the fact that if the budget authority will not make it possible to get the staff, we will not be able to do the job.	48.88463134584486
this is the situation as we see it.	8.461559550169026
we do not want to invest our own role as commissioners in fighting a losing battle.	65.97096206305558
we want to fight a battle we can be proud of participating in.	31.455437973799683
mr president, i am very happy to hear that, in order to fulfil commitments, more resources and personnel are required.	32.02436970585527
as parliament is aware of this, we will offer our full support.	9.979483502461735
however, i would like to ask a question, since i have not had time to study the document at length.	18.065577362742555
what will happen to humanitarian aid?	4.7025482875994316
we understand that the union' s policy of humanitarian aid does not end with simply granting it, but it has to continue - we talk in this context of a 'continuum' - so that development policies can be carried out.	49.84198198135853
otherwise, we may see a repetition of what is happening in mozambique at the moment: clearly, humanitarian aid was removed, echo disappeared, development policy is no longer being implemented and therefore, violence may erupt once again.	69.06266395210844
within this 'continuum' i would like to know whether, as has been the case until now, echo will be an office dependent on the commission, but whose action will be based on development policies aimed at what we want to see, and that is the eradication of poverty.	54.656958875986945
mr president, it is a shame that mr patten had to leave so soon.	33.40977648577387
i actually wanted to put my question to him.	9.628803272764351
but i think that mr nielson is equally well placed to answer me because he has been standing by his colleague' s side and he also said that both commissioners were responsible for the proposal.	52.04613069982513
mr nielson, of course we here in parliament share your aim of providing quicker aid to men and women, and raising the profile of the european union.	27.52104133877094
that goes without saying.	5.055884722983791
but we had all agreed that what the commission wanted to introduce now by way of reform had to be done jointly with us.	45.774740361144495
when mr patten says in his presentation that either the commission programme is accepted or we must make cuts, i find that highly displeasing.	54.59056173460303
it is we who are the budgetary authority, or at least part of it, and i think that the commission cannot simply say we shall make cuts or we shall have to make cuts.	35.682493535328184
that, if you please, has to go through the budgetary procedure first and what is certain is that you will have to implement your reform programme jointly with us.	71.84511680908844
i should like to know what your colleague meant by this threat.	29.129101984308836
mr president, i am very sorry that commissioner patten had to leave.	6.372064899923274
in his absence i am delighted to direct my questions to the development commissioner, mr nielson.	35.54500803209017
i am delighted to hear of new innovations and reorganisations which the commission is going to put into place.	15.810148576579959
europeaid would be a very important attribute of the european union as far as our external relations are concerned.	11.364112861170643
it has been extremely embarrassing so far that some of our promises have not been kept.	13.170580731355631
not keeping promises to the poorest people in the world is not the nicest way to go about - as a rich part of the world - trying to help them.	31.53539916136337
consolidating the relex commissioners and increasing the management support staff and resources have my fullest support.	97.72041490129273
i am also delighted to hear that they are planning to create a board very much like the world bank.	24.6014962932477
but i should like to ask commissioner nielson if he has thought about something which is very important to this side of the house - the ifc in the world bank has the ability to help in the private sector with funding.	34.8670221570056
micro-credits and various other mechanisms are key to helping people to help themselves.	29.1799112072266
have they considered extending, in europeaid, some element of helping people to help themselves through an investment arm where the european union becomes a partner in venture and enterprise?	68.17531487033429
firstly, echo is not affected by this reform of development assistance.	14.650997572493372
echo is going to continue.	0.7704267162471745
this is clearly part of what we have decided.	3.266858018100497
the only issue is to create a better link or bridge between the phase of humanitarian assistance and the more forward-oriented, long-term development assistance.	58.495374625979
this is a well established discussion.	10.682910761126367
we want to keep echo more or less the way it is.	33.576830593396544
i have confidence that with the new director of echo we are on track.	16.312620194859196
to mrs haug i should like to make it clear that commissioner patten was saying that we will have to propose deep cuts in the level of activity if we do not get a positive response from the budget authorities concerning the staff issue.	34.61493590281708
why are we saying this as clearly as we are, even running the risk of being interpreted as if issuing a threat?	66.69331240103361
i noticed your choice of word there.	15.400335534835797
we think it is necessary to make it clear that we seriously think it is problematic to continue without the resources and the manpower that we need.	21.130695083690032
it is not possible to do this well without being more or less organised like other well-performing donors.	61.85410604832932
this is the message.	5.245872623010937
it may very well be the case that we are being misunderstood in this parliament because, on this matter, we are definitely among friends.	20.905718038697703
so saying it as clearly as we do here may sound wrong.	41.16414100493159
i realise that.	-0.9948964408509597
but there are other elements around.	4.944982496476422
we have to say it à tous azimuts.	3.0283137070922086
it is absolutely necessary to make these measures clear.	11.147454595860852
i do not mean to be negative about ministers of finance, but sometimes they can be quite demanding partners in discussion.	93.65440531600379
development ministers are not that unproblematic either.	9.0184371486757
the biggest problem is actually the lack of consistency between the level of ambition defined in this field and the resources and tools that we have available to carry out the job.	32.999217126665535
this is our biggest problem.	5.828115326810522
we will be making a positive effort to get a solution that makes it possible to continue at least at the level of activity that we have now.	20.377734397473986
i should like to add that, though it is right to point out the backlog, the problems and the embarrassment, it should not be forgotten that we are building roads out there, thousands of kilometres in length; we are drilling bore-holes for clean, safe water, giving millions of people access to safe drinking water every year.	68.47080422750193
we are investing in people in primary education in a large number of countries.	18.883509201078233
we are making a contribution to the debt initiative second to none, even comparing ourselves with the biggest countries in the world.	38.40623329787166
we would welcome a little more competition as far as that is concerned.	9.286993017619759
i warn against giving the impression our development cooperation activities have all but stopped.	59.77018951374255
that is not the case.	3.433843486547377
we have to be realistic, clear and demanding in order to enter the primary league amongst donors and not to remain where we are right now.	53.63245620396819
this is the goal.	4.625456435602601
mr deva, we will, as part of the new suva agreement - the successor to the lomé convention - be including in our activities a eur 2.2 billion private investment facility which will be administered by the european investment bank at arm's length.	63.12974698957654
it will deal with private partners, inspiring and helping the creation of business activities between european companies and business in the developing acp countries.	57.724931181422754
this major innovation is being prepared right now on the same basis as you were talking about.	28.83642905852458
micro-credit is a big thing but it is not the only answer to all problems.	12.8585056131797
however, we are quite active in this field also.	9.64020199529907
i thank parliament for what i sense to be a more than positive reception because the critical notes that i have heard are of a kind that i would tend to interpret as enthusiastic support.	80.60145391927915
we should be careful not to end up facing a situation where there is a real threat of having to set our sights lower.	30.655068732302976
thank you very much, mr nielson, for your optimistic view of the future.	19.081043939395197
question time (commission)	1.211993049093206
the next item is question time (b5-0220/2000). we will examine questions to the commission.	15.659955106108715
first part	118.42338930208832
question no 32 by (h-0433/00):	2.2211804243628053
subject: jailing of opposition politician xu wenli in china is the commission aware of the recent trial involving xu wenli in china and the severe prison sentence that was imposed.	128.25299228471687
what action did the commission take?	1.6498478916058374
the commission is aware of the recent trial referred to by the honourable member in his question and of the sentence imposed on mr liu, who assisted xu wenli in setting up a branch of the banned china democracy party.	102.77950453952647
xu wenli, one of the founders of the cdp, was sentenced to 13 years in jail in december 1998, along with two other prominent democracy campaigners.	44.32508852546911
as the honourable member will know, the longstanding policy of the union is to raise the individual cases of chinese citizens who have been in prison for political offences with the chinese authorities, particularly in the context of the human rights dialogue, the last meeting of which took place on 25 february this year.	58.87771157462017
the union has therefore raised with the chinese government the cases of xu wenli and others who have been trying to exercise basic rights that are specified by the united nation's covenant on civil and political rights, which was actually signed by china in october 1998.	81.02592619382986
to date, the commission knows that at least 23 cdp members have been jailed for subversion as a result of their efforts to exercise those rights to which china is committed.	34.23384637992377
in relation to these and other cases, the commission consistently calls upon the people's republic of china to comply with the letter and spirit of the united nation's human rights conventions which it has signed; to do so even before china's ratification of those conventions and actively to pursue ratification.	93.07616148480083
these efforts by the commission will continue.	6.480617668496218
i thank you, commissioner, for your answer and i should like to ask whether the commission is aware that 14 months into his 13-year prison sentence mr xu is suffering from hepatitis and there are serious doubts as to the effectiveness of the medical treatment he is receiving.	63.69811324956538
i would seek an assurance that the commission will enquire into this and ask the chinese authorities whether they are providing the appropriate medical treatment.	32.39958172881151
bearing in mind, commissioner, what you said about your willingness to raise individual cases, could i also ask you to make enquiries about the fate of rebiya kadeer.	31.73071419865743
she was arrested on 11 august 1999 in urumqui, the capital of the xuar, while on her way to meet representatives of the us congressional research service.	63.33673222496771
she was charged with providing secret information to foreigners and is believed to have been sentenced to eight years' imprisonment at a secret trial.	64.79542204887615
i will gladly provide more detailed information on that, mr commissioner.	36.30800278955384
it makes me even more angry that european union member states, faced with these cases and the 23 in general you referred to, show such spinelessness in refusing to support the us initiative in geneva at the un commission on human rights attacking china's human rights record.	115.8568393618158
i should like to tell the honourable member that in respect to mr xu, i will convey what he said about the apparently grave condition of that political prisoner to my colleagues in the external relations area.	62.569428427489804
i am certain that they will follow previous practice in making enquiries of the chinese authorities as to the quality and consistency of the treatment of mr xu for hepatitis.	35.91300813367275
i know that my colleagues will be happy to respond to the honourable member in order to keep him informed with any information they are able to obtain.	22.522414085208304
so far as miss kadeer is concerned, obviously i did not have notice of that question and am not in a position to respond.	48.91068003757511
the question will, however, have been recorded.	3.9538724240905214
i will bring it to the attention of my colleagues and they will provide the honourable member with the response he is seeking.	24.02604577714514
obviously, it would be a matter of great concern if someone, whose only offence is to be antagonistic towards an existing regime, were to be the victim of insufferable treatment.	45.188893512720206
i know that my colleagues elsewhere in the commission share this view, which i share with the honourable member.	34.45153012496213
question no 34 by (h-0357/00):	3.29746763152672
subject: the commission's reform programme and enlargement on 1 march 2000, the commission adopted the white paper on the reform of the commission.	13.670933611187953
the measures and actions announced in the white paper provide for a radical reform of the commission which will involve a considerable amount of time.	33.565428676514514
can the commission indicate to what extent the present reform proposals take account of the forthcoming enlargement?	30.94650877020982
do they anticipate the consequences which enlargement will have on the internal structure of the commission and do the proposed measures and actions take account of such consequences?	39.16810002350666
if so, in what way? if not, would it not have been more logical for the commission to take account of enlargement in respect of certain aspects, thereby avoiding a situation whereby shortly after completion of the current reform process the commission has to enter into a fresh round of reforms to cope with the impact of enlargement?	102.54666574378392
does the commission intend to present an action plan with a timetable, as is the case with the present reform plan, in order to prepare the structure of the commission for the forthcoming enlargement?	24.945564267786374
the commission's reform strategy white paper fulfils the undertakings readily given to parliament and to the council last year to give immediate attention to addressing the way in which the institution, as an organisation, currently undertakes its duties.	113.9795753717235
delay in designing a practical strategy and in pursuing necessary modernisation would not have been acceptable to the commission, to the council, to this parliament or to the public, as i am sure the honourable member understands.	49.093351832824496
one of the specifically stated purposes of comprehensive reform is the development of strengthened administrative performance which will, amongst other things, enable the commission to deal more effectively with changes in the current and the future union and in the wider world.	142.41318130051593
clearly the challenges posed by the forthcoming extensive enlargement are different in nature and scale than those presented by any previous enlargement.	78.42760333971499
the commission must therefore be capable of achieving the highest standards of executive and administrative performance in the discharge of its powers and duties in order to facilitate that massive and welcome development.	59.15390433261522
as the college of commissioners made clear in our introduction to the white paper, and elsewhere in that document, and i quote what we said: "the challenges of globalisation and future enlargement require better governance at all levels including the european union".	143.46871854336993
all political institutions must rise to this challenge and so must the commission.	20.297945287378596
reform is therefore an essential precondition - a precondition for realising our vision of europe.	35.28731500457678
the current administrative reform is not a limited exercise - it is an evolutionary process as we have made very clear - it will be continuously monitored and the results achieved will be assessed in order to provide for any relevant adjustments.	46.621362311860715
proper account will be taken of any specific requirements that arise from the enlargement process, and naturally that will apply to human resources implications of the ongoing change.	70.96370962105742
issues such as the management of the increased cultural diversity within the commission and an early retirement scheme that is directly linked to enlargement will, for instance, be amongst those that receive particular attention.	93.20844470586447
as with past enlargements, specific measures concerning the appointment and integration of officials from the new member states will be adopted at the appropriate time.	34.656399391172506
i would like to thank the commissioner for his response.	2.2792847034913652
i would, however, like to add something.	2.105915305207528
one of the main challenges in the enlargement process will be to tailor the veterinary and plant-health conditions prevalent in the acceding countries to those in the european union.	36.36653685439507
would the commissioner be prepared to encourage observers from the central and eastern european countries that wish to join the eu, to attend management committees, scientific committees or any other committees concerned with veterinary and plant health, on a permanent basis?	151.10835102382583
mr president, the honourable member's approach to these and many other matters is i know extremely constructive.	41.54526996090206
what i know on the basis of precedent, and also the commission's assessment of the scope and the depth of the challenges that arise from the forthcoming enlargement, is that appropriate measures will be taken at the right time not only in terms of the recruitment and integration of properly skilled staff from the new member states but also to assist with the preparation of other areas of expertise - presumably including the scientific and other committees.	57.89694626878697
to some extent, of course, the process will be assisted by the fact that the international science community inside and outside the european union is genuinely international.	40.82753679948276
in addition to relying upon those casual professional relationships, i am sure that the commission will want to ensure that there is continuity and access provided for those new incoming member states not only in areas like those that he has mentioned - veterinary and plant health - but in many other areas where the smoothest possible integration of efforts is a matter of crucial and mutual importance.	84.26496062905356
question no 35 by (h-0411/00):	3.1276672148081035
subject: boarding of community vessels by canadian inspectors in international waters five years after the seizure of the estai, the community fleet fishing in nafo international waters has expressed deep concern at the boarding of a portuguese vessel, the santa mafalda, supposedly by canadian inspectors.	104.94381542205348
the santa mafalda, a vessel used to catch halibut, was boarded on 24 april last. the inspectors confiscated all documentation and refused to leave the vessel.	62.779220800590565
furthermore, a launch belonging to the canadian authorities has been tracking the vessel constantly, thus hampering its fishing activity.	41.47148732723408
a few days earlier, canadian inspectors had apparently boarded a spanish freezer trawler, which was also fishing in international waters.	77.9546862116957
european fishermen fear that the underlying aim of these boarding incidents is to deter them from using the fishing grounds in which they catch halibut and cod.	45.19050520528022
what information does the commission possess on these incidents?	7.222017531480219
can it clarify whether the inspectors were acting on behalf of nafo or the canadian government?	28.226373656903593
has it taken any action in this regard, or does it intend to do so?	21.073583218380215
should accepting community monitoring rules for inspections in nafo waters prove problematic for canada, what initiatives could the commission take to set clear and binding rules which would allay the doubts of those working in the sector and the canadian government alike?	107.97625057308808
thank you mr president.	1.0230723205167584
as the honourable member who raised the question will know, in accordance with the northwest atlantic fisheries organisation scheme of joint international inspection and surveillance, each contracting party may assign means of inspection and inspectors to the nafo scheme and nafo inspectors may inspect any fishing vessel flying the flag of a contracting party.	135.44561192822684
nafo inspectors are obliged to carry out their duties in accordance with rules set out in the nafo scheme and they are also obliged to remain under the operational control of the authorities of their contracting parties and be responsible to them.	43.53553429306557
against that background, on 23 april two canadian nafo inspectors accompanied by a trainee carried out an inspection of the community fishing vessel santa mafalda which was operating at that time in the nafo regulatory area.	89.1826084053736
the canadian inspectors in question and the surveillance vessel from which the inspection was carried out are assigned to the nafo scheme.	32.74481557730882
their inspection was carried out under its auspices.	6.239612206820167
having been informed by the canadians, inspectors of the commission boarded the santa mafalda to verify the grounds on which the canadian inspectors based their citation of a serious infringement.	31.50930135688077
in conducting this verification the commission inspectors ensured the security and continuity of the evidence on board and transmitted their report to the portuguese authorities.	112.29118540191575
those authorities in turn ordered the santa mafalda to the port of aveiro in portugal for a thorough inspection.	29.148532471535635
the santa mafalda arrived in aveiro on 10 may 2000 and two commission inspectors participated in a thorough inspection of the vessel.	61.310823373943315
the commission has drawn the attention of the canadian authorities to the procedures followed by the canadian inspectors in relation to their seizure of documentation and their continued stay on board the santa mafalda.	48.28519615128255
the commission takes the view that the canadian nafo inspectors in question acted in breach of the nafo scheme by taking away documents from the vessel without the permission of the master and by continuing to stay on board the vessel.	88.66846885017792
however, it is relevant to note that in this case the master of the vessel and the portuguese authorities did not oppose the prolonged stay of the canadian inspectors on the vessel and the fishing activities of the santa mafalda were not obstructed.	45.87874858474292
mr commissioner, i am satisfied with your reply, but i would like to add something else.	15.944254848924615
the sea is a difficult world, and the community fleet which fishes in international atlantic waters experiences the interference of controllers and patrols from coastal countries which give the impression that, behind the harassment they sometimes suffer, there is one sole intention; to expel them from those fishing grounds.	106.25734044649528
the commissioner knows, as i do, that the current situation in the nafo is not, fortunately, what it was five years ago after the seizure of the estai.	26.35800632877746
the european commission - like the fishing sector itself - has made significant efforts to iron out our differences.	47.678767468663935
however, there are still outstanding questions, such as the extraterritorial clauses, which allow the canadian government to carry out inspections, controls and seizures beyond their national waters, in open sea, which is incompatible with international provisions and which, all too frequently, involves the arbitrary application of controls within the framework of the nafo.	78.8675884080278
for all these reasons, i would like to ask the commissioner how the european commission intends to defend the right of the community fleet to fish freely in these waters, albeit within the existing rules.	42.02410707027552
mr president, i am grateful to the honourable lady.	5.76966770168763
the only way in which we can actually ensure the proper maintenance of an international convention which has the effect of law is to demand on all occasions that the procedures required under the law are fulfilled properly in a balanced but a completely full way.	70.71644066220826
that is the position being taken by the commission which is why i drew attention to the fact that the commissioners have already reached the conclusion that the canadian inspectors actually acted in breach of the scheme by taking documents without the sight of the master and by virtue, maybe, of their very prolonged stay on board that vessel.	65.66107121280851
the portuguese authorities, as the honourable lady will know because of her interest, are now undertaking a full investigation and it would therefore not be proper for the commission to communicate opinions beyond those i have already offered, but she can be absolutely certain that the commission and its inspectors together with the member states are vigilant in sustaining the proper rights of all vessels on the high seas.	81.81307726681233
mr president, i had asked the question as a result of mr kinnock' s first reply, before mrs miguélez asked her question.	23.407915432352983
i had understood from mr kinnock that the ship was in fact being inspected in a portuguese port and that this inspection had taken place in the presence of community inspectors.	85.52545142931291
i understand, from his second reply, that he does not yet have the result of that inspection.	25.523618603697013
that is what i wanted him to clarify.	5.925245008641943
if he does have it, i would like him to say so, but i understand from his second reply that he does not.	50.8916866986593
if that is the case i believe it would be prudent and logical for us to await the final result.	30.632506623586018
i would ask mr kinnock to communicate to mr fischler that, as chairman of the committee on fisheries, i would like to know the result of that inspection as soon as possible.	25.641696004696914
i would like to receive it because this parliament will have to act accordingly.	14.886008456195945
in any event, i would like to condemn, in support of mrs miguélez, the abuse of authority on the part of the canadian nafo inspectors which mr kinnock mentioned.	34.876481915594624
i would therefore like to make that request and condemn this violation of nafo regulations.	20.349150650278155
mr president, i will draw the honourable member's remarks to the attention of my colleague, mr fischler, and i know that they will be of interest to him.	37.36782465602977
he summarises the position precisely because the inspection has taken place and the portuguese authorities are reaching their conclusions.	56.17777389094514
it would not be proper publicly to pursue the matter further, but when the report of that inspection and the assessment by the portuguese authorities are available, i am certain that they will be communicated to interested members including, of course, the chairman of parliament's committee on fisheries and i am certain the honourable lady whose interest is manifest.	91.34940153053891
question no 36 by (h-0415/00):	1.058461689695556
subject: need to support and strengthen the olive oil sector the implementation of the new olive oil regulation is having severe consequences for greek producers who are poor farmers in infertile and island regions.	80.19268536598652
the abolition of the intervention price which had already been eroded has brought producer prices down to derisory levels: together with the co-responsibility levy this has had the effect of decimating olive oil producers' incomes.	60.26390184280188
the profiteering of traders who sell olive oil to the consumer at prices many times the producers' price have increased, and the small quota accorded to greece in practice cancels out the entitlement to plant a further 3 000 hectares provided for in the new regulation.	163.51097365745048
since olive oil is a basic product and the main source of income for farmers from the most disadvantaged regions in greece and is also a staple of the mediterranean diet, will the commission say what measures it intends to take to protect olive oil cultivation and producers' incomes so as to enable them to stay on the land and when it intends to act?	58.43520875256567
does it intend to increase the quota in order to cover existing production and the volume of production expected to result from the new plantations?	26.230606701775045
will it reintroduce the institution of intervention, but improved as far as prices and the date of commencement are concerned?	28.272806395294648
finally, will it draw up and implement an integrated and effective policy to promote and advertise olive oil both in the eu countries and in third countries, so that olive oil can occupy the place to which it is entitled - according to scientific findings - in the human diet?	62.467453112251306
second part	126.15876341646843
questions to mr solbes	6.737260187465268
one of the greatest benefits of the question time arrangement is the way in which it endows me with instant expertise on issues as far apart as fishing, olive oil and human rights in china!	111.0407739554734
i am happy to respond to mr korakas.	2.424431459217733
in june 1998, the commission undertook to present a proposal on the future of the common organisation of the market in olive oil to the council and parliament in 2000.	27.101971028657907
the new regime would apply from the 2001/2002 marketing year which, as the honourable member will know, begins on 1 november 2001.	71.24950432468313
the commission is currently studying new data on the structure of olive oil production in the various producer member states, as well as developments in the world market where the community is the leading producer by a considerable margin.	97.28852622758093
the study will also take into account the need to draw up an olive oil quality strategy in order to add more value to the product.	24.655108046733634
as far as product promotion is concerned, the community is already financing promotion campaigns through the international olive oil council.	195.07913193026872
those campaigns appear to have a positive effect within the european union and indeed in third countries.	9.185283107369441
in response to a specific issue raised by the honourable member's question, i have to point out that the produce of new plantings would not give entitlement to aid.	48.54600215879199
however, the commission hopes that the community producers concerned will benefit fully under derogations from the rules as they relate to approved planting programmes, although the olive oil in question would count towards the maximum guaranteed quantity which has already been set.	174.3994901362186
finally, the commission wishes to point out that rather than simply abolishing the intervention system, what has actually happened is that it has been replaced by a system of private storage which is more flexible than the intervention system because it applies throughout the marketing year if the market situation calls for such support.	107.11801877706898
since the start of the 1998/99 marketing year, it has not been necessary to pay private storage aid.	46.95976678147045
however, it is worth emphasising that over that same period the old buying-in intervention system would not have been activated either.	78.12775421755704
mr president, we do indeed appear to be having problems understanding each other in this chamber.	51.66257816569227
because of the policies of the european union, olive oil producers are truly at the mercy of big producers who negotiate among themselves and try to buy olive oil at unbelievably low prices.	109.85462597331706
this situation has reached dramatic proportions with the abolition of the albeit downgraded intervention system and the system of private storage, let me assure you is, quite frankly, a joke.	72.56544273129339
so how are we to deal with this situation?	5.853641842560948
will an improved intervention system providing rudimentary protection for producers be reintroduced?	43.40821552739197
and given that, on a global scale, olive oil is so important to the human body and plays such an important role in maintaining farming populations in disadvantaged areas, why is it that the quotas, particularly for greece, are so low?	118.58717669240681
are you going to increase them?	7.276199980160326
and with the widespread practice of mixing olive oil with sunflower seed oil, what does the commission intend to do to put a stop to this practice, which is harming producers and consumers to the benefit of industrial racketeers?	66.46212262173036
in this spirit, does the commission believe that this phenomenon can be tackled through guile, i.e., by increasing the quota for italy, which is the main country responsible for mixing oil, and reducing the quota for greece?	53.2205657559397
i am grateful to the honourable member and i know of the deep concerns he voices. they certainly are communicated in this house and he does it in a most articulate fashion.	32.18939987436358
all i can say to him at this juncture, because i know this is a matter of continuing concern and activity by him, is that the cmo for olive oil is due to be reformed, as i indicated earlier, by 1 november 2001, following agreement in the council and in this parliament in adopting regulation 1638/98.	69.80032280613354
i cannot assume that if the situation were precisely as the honourable member describes, and smaller producers were in a dangerously disadvantaged position by comparison with the big producers, there would have been such agreement in the council and in this house.	58.46582299072578
therefore, i hope he will give attention to the results of the studies i mentioned being undertaken at the moment by the commission, both in terms of the general questions he raised when he submitted his question and also in terms of the relative fortunes of big producers and small producers.	59.12642138316175
finally, as someone who is merely a consumer of olive oil, i hope there is no extensive dilution of what is one of my favourite complementary foodstuffs and that, whatever else we do in the european community, we strive together with olive oil producers of all sizes to maintain the maximum quality.	122.48477598463383
that is how we sustain our considerable lead in world markets.	64.39246278695045
thank you very much, mr kinnock, for your cooperation during this question time.	19.57297604593377
we also congratulate you for using olive oil, which is very good for the health.	24.772543462539158
i also say this from a mediterranean standpoint.	7.501742773952616
question no 37 by (h-0409/00):	2.344473835289998
subject: further integration entailed by emu in the commission's estimation, to what extent do the requirements imposed by emu on economic policy - which include permanently fixed exchange rates - create the need for further economic integration in the form of a more extensive common budget (a common fiscal policy), cyclical transfers between member states, increased labour mobility between the participating states and/or a more flexible labour market?	269.244766273188
the introduction of the euro will increase economic integration and reinforce the positive effects of the single market, primarily by eliminating the risks relating to exchange rates.	50.84093249809921
there are also other factors. there is greater transparency in prices, an improvement in competition and an increase in trade and investment both cross-border and also between other countries or areas affected by monetary union.	108.18571811035288
at the same time, as the common monetary policy will mean the same interest rate for all member states of the monetary union, it will not only have an effect in terms of developing demand, but it will also mean greater integration of the financial markets.	48.78497558297486
this should also bring benefits for savers and investors.	16.743441607108643
for this to have the greatest positive effect, it is essential that we carry out a policy of rationalised public finances, which will not generate tensions in monetary policy itself, and at the same time, a decisive policy of structural reforms and a competition policy, which will allow the maximum benefit to be drawn from the process.	52.41601299250537
in order for economic and monetary union to function successfully, we do not need a major budget which will allow cyclical transfers in the event of difficulties.	32.707859912580716
i believe that the treaty, supplemented by the stability and growth pact, provides adequate instruments to implement an economic policy which is compatible with a unified monetary policy.	89.79512109290354
the basic framework which we have introduced is a framework of mutual supervision of national fiscal policies and of coordination of economic policies by means of processes to improve our structural situations and the coordination or creation of a positive macroeconomic environment which will favour growth and employment, and at the same time reduce the possibility of asymmetric clashes caused by economic policies.	86.09918548562209
budgetary consolidation itself, which is, of course, the reduction of the public deficit, gives each member state room to act in adverse situations.	41.24923654754255
greater labour mobility may certainly help to confront the problems which may arise in the event of asymmetric clashes.	15.17922043889321
both an increase in the available work force and an improvement in productivity would improve the situation in terms of creating jobs and helping to reduce unemployment.	43.3509607422974
that is why we attach particular importance to labour mobility.	15.333827636326966
the commission has therefore insisted on its various strategies regarding the specific point of labour mobility, while remaining aware that this is a difficult issue.	61.156870109435765
it is difficult within member states and it is difficult between one member state and another, due not only to historical and cultural incompatibilities in terms of education, but also to a series of other aspects related to this type of situation.	51.46895763258828
finally, i would say that clearly these difficulties which are being considered - and which may arise in the future - will surely be much less serious than those which have been brought up in theory by people who study monetary union, given that - and this is our experience to date - we are seeing an approximation of the economic policies of the countries and we have created room, in monetary terms, for us to confront difficulties more easily than in the past.	72.5233372103607
thank you very much for your answer which, up to a point, contains many of the features i had expected.	60.53401237239611
i should like to follow up your answer and ask you what is meant by saying that the euro project will not be a success unless there is a large budget which can cope with fluctuations in the trade cycle.	41.99416665053158
what kind of large budget?	1.2712926502413344
is it a large eu budget which is being considered?	12.351601253703091
i should also like to hear whether it can be imagined continuing with a policy based upon recommendations and exhortations to the euro zone countries.	27.954747718408314
for example, denmark has, in fact, on a number of occasions disregarded recommendations from the commission.	14.649408669057287
is this state of affairs to be accepted in the long term or will the stability and growth pact be followed up and a stable environment ensured for emu by adopting working methods of a type different from those involving recommendations and exhortations?	181.98210346067754
in your reply - or comment - i note two implicit questions.	35.62284196986952
firstly, a major budget is essential to tackle the cyclical difficulties.	12.801250369702498
this would lead us into a very complex debate. the problems are not caused by clashes themselves, but by asymmetric clashes; asymmetric clashes differ depending on whether they are temporary or permanent, whether they relate to supply or demand.	84.63188939777899
we have little experience to help us define a typology and lay down a single formula for resolving these difficulties by budgetary means.	57.87899510976525
we believe that it is a much better idea to establish a general framework of economic health, of good economic behaviour, which will allow us to confront the difficulties in the case in question.	43.60331426095056
in the future we will continue with recommendations to comply with the stability and growth pact.	26.29845091586063
i do not know whether it is a good or a bad thing, but that is our obligation as the commission.	21.77473538531746
this is an agreement adopted by the council of ministers as a result of initiatives by certain member states and which i also support, since i believe that a good budgetary policy provides greater room for manoeuvre in the event of difficulties.	37.93528138538684
earlier i referred to the fact that the situation is different in each of the member states.	3.833842974603553
in this year' s recommendations we have taken particular account of the commission' s own analyses regarding what the margins are, and which benchmarks we are setting in each of the member states to tackle the crisis without exceeding the 3% public deficit, which is the figure we have established as a reference.	53.91134115293129
we can see that that situation is different in each of the countries and, therefore, our recommendations and our comments will always be different in each of the countries, although this is not the only aspect that we take into consideration.	39.84686088695772
mr president, the current weakness and volatility of the euro is a cause of concern both within and outside the euro-zone.	47.93239226883652
does the commissioner feel that the current stability pact and the powers of the european central bank are sufficient to force the euro-land states to make the difficult and fundamental adjustments in their economic and labour markets, which are essential if the euro is going to be taken seriously by the global financial markets?	53.37037374129998
i do not see any great correlation between the two questions, but i do note that the euro is being taken seriously.	32.70830188137846
what has happened with the euro?	2.503459214285548
there are many technical explanations as to why we are in this situation.	22.623550462623772
this would require a broader debate, focussing on the starting point, which is the development of economic forecasts and the real economies of each of the areas. it would also clearly concern changes in interest rates and certain other technical elements, such as expiry dates for certain types of issues etc.	124.5416261690478
the reality is that, by analysing the euro on the basis, fundamentally, of the evolution of the exchange rate, we are making an incorrect evaluation of its introduction.	58.30736335438558
the euro has been a great success, in terms of its introduction, in terms of issuing it as a currency, in terms of the consolidation of an excellent economic situation in europe and in terms of the forecasts for the future.	30.6418847167276
it is true that the interest rate is not what we would have liked.	10.079145100190479
we believe that a strong economy means a strong euro.	25.087420136264235
we also believe that the development of growth in europe will be strong throughout 2000 and, as a result, we will match us growth by the end of this year.	34.588338114387135
in these circumstances, we believe that the value of the euro will be rising in the coming months.	10.467723358965117
therefore, despite a certain degree of concern - because that concern exists within public opinion - about the evolution of the euro, we believe that this situation will be corrected and that it should be considered to be temporary rather than permanent.	36.062751472509674
mr president, in my opinion, the supplementary question by mr purvis was most pertinent, since recently the need for increased economic cooperation amongst the emu countries has been justified by precisely this weakening of the value of the euro in relation to the us dollar.	57.590507880728815
the reason for the dollar becoming stronger in comparison to the euro is simply that the national economy of the usa is stronger than that of the euro countries.	65.22629098290109
hundreds of thousands of new jobs have recently been created in the usa, while the number of jobs in europe has been cut.	14.573337317128471
i would like to ask the commissioner firstly, whether the commission admits that the weakening of the euro that has been much thrashed out in public, is a consequence of the infrastructural problems and lack of dynamism of the eu economy, particularly in relation to the usa, and whether he really believes that the kind of keynesian action as proposed by mrs frahm would be the cure for this weakening of the euro, and whether he believes that the commission will achieve better results in this matter, when the national governments of france and germany have actually proceeded in the totally opposite direction, and their actions have weakened even further the competitiveness of the euro area.	85.99043258631013
as an example, i refer here to the decisions made by the french government on working hours.	20.046498107366567
i will try to reply briefly, although these are complex questions and i will therefore have to give this point some attention.	56.25231309102379
firstly, with regard to increasing cooperation in terms of coordinating economic policies, i believe that it is necessary and positive and is one of the elements which is emerging from this current crisis.	41.01611480591128
the french president has highlighted this and it will obviously be a point for debate during the next presidency.	25.008890738732855
i do not agree with the theory that the euro' s development is leading to a fall in employment in europe and an increase in employment in the usa.	22.007442080649128
transfers of capital may generate additional activity in the united states, but the positive increase in exports is generating activity in europe.	76.18701719577452
it would require a very complex and profound debate to deal with this issue.	16.998958014724593
in any event, what i do believe - as i said earlier - is that the euro, at the moment, has an exchange rate which, if we analyse it in relation to its components and its historical situation, is not that different from situations which have existed at other times.	107.87226764963538
i am convinced that this is a transitional situation which will improve during this year.	13.50819226743966
question no 38 by (h-0419/00):	2.207108211323633
subject: precarious employment and the industrial-accident rate in spain and in the murcia region at the lisbon summit, a commitment was made to achieving full employment in proper jobs throughout the eu.	39.02556387631373
in response to the french government' s proposal involving a reduction in working hours in order to create more proper, stable jobs, the approach agreed between the spanish and uk governments, which calls for further deregulation of employment conditions in order to increase the number of jobs, has been adopted.	68.75204693244848
spain' s experience over the last four years has demonstrated that jobs are indeed created but are predominantly casual and precarious in nature, and they are associated with a high rate of industrial accidents, the murcia region being the part of spain where that rate is highest.	69.33596223695582
does the commission not think that there is an urgent case for monitoring the conditions under which jobs are being created in the various eu countries and regions, so as to ensure that job-creation is not at the expense of the stability and dignity of workers and especially of young people entering the job market for the first time?	47.11672575201822
questions to mr verheugen	7.425602056392067
mr president, despite the fact that i was born next to the murcia region, it is difficult for me to analyse, in community terms, the problems of the precarious employment there.	40.06167781014689
therefore, allow me to make a rather more general comment.	8.790753065748694
the assessment of the labour market reforms which have resulted from the processes we have established in the union - the luxembourg process and the broad guidelines for economic policy - demonstrates that the reforms of the regulations on the labour market in the different countries are making a positive and significant contribution to greater economic growth and to promoting the creation of employment and the greater participation of men and women in the labour market.	48.39119632645845
the broad guidelines of economic policy and the recommendations for employment have never advocated a simple deregulation of the labour market, as the question states.	47.81516277266629
together with the reform of certain labour market regulations, they also include, for example, the need to adopt measures which will promote entrepreneurial spirit or active labour market policies - and we state this quite deliberately - to improve employment opportunities.	146.41401901858663
the measures adopted in each member state must be adapted to the problems and reality of each of them.	15.98904166625755
it is also quite normal for the commission to insist on the need to hold debates and make agreements with social partners so that they may actively participate in the changes to the labour market in each country.	53.22550206358736
as well as a significant and lasting increase in the levels of employment, one of the key priorities of the employment strategy is to improve the quality of jobs.	24.560816767403963
the recent lisbon summit gave a new impulse to the union' s economic and social agenda and we have also insisted on this point by talking of more and better employment.	28.922493044581778
i would also like to highlight, as a fundamental contribution to the consolidation of the progress made until now, the promotion and maintenance of rigorous regulations on health and safety at work, which has been one of the most prominent issues in the debate held in the commission, which advocates better jobs in europe.	61.10925323438979
labour market reforms directed at improving employment opportunities and workers' ability to adapt to these new opportunities in no way seek to undermine working conditions or health and safety at work.	126.98353226123609
in accordance with its legal competence as laid down in the treaty, the commission has kept up the necessary efforts to implement and propose various legal instruments and monitor the incorporation of the acquis communautaire in this area.	52.73330470267273
with regard to your specific question and the case of spain, it is spain' s responsibility, like the other members, to apply the commission' s directives.	41.55211415691129
it is also the responsibility of the member states to monitor the application of these directives in all of their regions.	11.824869426662003
the commission must guarantee that those directives are transposed into national law correctly and, clearly, to monitor all the issues relating to its application, which is the responsibility of the national authorities.	54.76422291210116
i am grateful to mr solbes for the intention behind his reply, which is to safeguard and show concern for worker' s conditions.	46.90425555879702
nevertheless, the political analysis of the lisbon summit reveals that there were two proposals: one which was more social, more committed, which came from the french prime minister, mr jospin, and the other, resulting from a previous agreement between mr blair and mr aznar, deregulating the labour market and making it more flexible. the latter proposal won the day.	82.46743301640055
if we take spain as an example, it is clear that job instability, temporary employment and work accidents are on the increase.	83.69751962510077
do you not therefore believe that it would be appropriate, in the review of the treaty of amsterdam, to incorporate the social charter with specific instruments and measures, as occurred with the five classic points of the treaty of maastricht, in order to guarantee full employment and employment quality and that it therefore not be left to the whim of each of the countries?	56.726814473718186
by way of clarification, reference has been made to the number of work accidents in murcia because it has such a sad record within spain; that is why we are concerned.	49.0472833710867
i imagined that was the reason for the reference to murcia, and not the fact that i was born next to that province.	26.371008293733876
with regard to the basic problem, i would make a different comment.	20.85644387566861
our concern has always been not only greater employment but also greater quality of employment.	16.81860968591239
in the broad guidelines for economic policy for this year, and in the specific recommendation for spain, we expressly refer to the need for the problems to be analysed, amongst them the cost of dismissal, which may be important with regard to temporary employment, because we believe that a distinction should be made between precariousness and flexibility, which are two very different things.	60.67231360480173
nevertheless, you introduced a second element in your supplementary question which, in my opinion, is of great interest: why do we not establish the objective of full employment in the same way that we established the objectives of the treaty of maastricht at the time?	41.54455609378547
basically because they are two completely different types of figure.	9.58680233783939
at maastricht, what we put in place was compliance with obligations dependent on voluntary decisions adopted by the member states which form the european union.	36.58015679297713
in the case of full employment, the figure is the consequence of measures which are intended to achieve an objective, but which do not have a causal relationship which guarantees its objective.	34.27938667169468
what we can consider is what is being done in the various employment programmes, and that is the implementation of certain elements which will allow us to move towards full employment.	28.538231398536443
when we spoke of full employment in the commission document which served as a basis for the debate in lisbon, we expressly said that if we add the development of the economy in accordance with currently available figures to the various determining factors and policies proposed by the commission, full employment will be achieved.	69.85829995107079
however, this cannot be a political objective, as in maastricht, because it does not depend on the will of the different governments or on a specific decision by each one of them.	39.28238537148167
i would like to say that, in order to judge from afar, it is often necessary to understand the reality.	12.529079969995497
in the countries of the southern mediterranean, and specifically in the region of murcia, they have, in recent years, stopped managing unemployment and started to manage employment.	65.4668526440388
they have moved from an extraordinary and terrifying level of unemployment, originating in the great state industries whose economic model was unsustainable, through a crisis and then to a situation involving the growth of small businesses (smbs) and economic incentives which have generated a new and vibrant model.	107.25420200445257
however, it is clear that accidents in the workplace - which i am now talking about - are a problem of education and mutual responsibility on the part of businessmen, the state, public administration and, of course, trade unions.	49.245217481779775
unless they all work in unison, they will not achieve this objective.	9.680694667799598
in spain, back in 1995, a law was adopted in this respect, and they are trying to comply with it, but this cannot be achieved in a day.	26.28682093488849
therefore, commissioner, firstly, what active policies and which economic sectors do you intend to bring into play in order to achieve better education in this particular area, so that a sense of responsibility may be developed?	51.84932914360657
secondly and very specifically: is there any programme to educate immigrants in the language of their host country, so that we can educate them to understand the minimum safety standards in this region which is host to many immigrants who do not speak our language?	80.97148382222788
thank you for your comments.	1.1046905359938046
with regard to your questions, i will say again that the distribution of responsibilities between the commission and the member states dictates that these matters fall to the member states.	28.261990456564014
consequently, both the funding of these immigrant education programmes and the active policies are decisions which logically depend on which social policy the spanish government accepts or decides on.	199.88453504811164
question no 39 by (h-0352/00):	3.305331908836081
subject: adaptation of the applicant countries will the commission indicate the total number of documents that have been sent to the applicant countries as well as the total volume of the 'acquis' and will it consider forms of cooperation that do not require the applicant countries to accept every rule?	40.82795792388057
mr president, ladies and gentlemen, the entire community acquis, i.e. all the legal acts of the european union without exception were sent to the candidate countries immediately after the resolution of the luxembourg european council in december 1997, during the course of screening.	54.047237969209164
no-one has ever counted them and i cannot therefore tell you how many there are.	23.067481202110994
we usually talk of just over 20 000 legal acts in this context.	20.812035979763316
mr president, there is not very much to thank the commission for.	6.253305885209505
i find it completely incomprehensible that there should be an institution which is unable to put together elementary statistics concerning the existing rules, which is unable to add up how much money is being sent to the candidate countries, which is unable to provide some general numerical information so that ordinary people can follow what is happening and which is unable to supply the total acquis on a cd-rom to anyone who might be interested in it.	79.48436232866462
it is really quite simple. i have worked on it for a good many years.	21.299010863963343
it is completely impossible even for organisations with academic employees to find out how extensive the 'acquis' is, and it is apparently impossible for mr vanhengen to give the entire acquis to a member of the european parliament who is quite prepared to go through it and distribute the tasks among the different employees in order to see what positions are to be adopted on its various aspects.	75.37125652769012
so there is nothing to thank the commission for.	6.689449050909554
mr president, mr bonde, we have met each other face to face here before, and i personally am having to exercise a great deal of self-control in order to maintain the necessary degree of decorum in the house.	47.41922435232127
the legal acts which we are talking about here are legal acts passed by the council, by parliament, by the commission and by all the community institutions.	36.94299829946106
you, as a member of the most important legislative institution of the european union know full well that these legal acts have not been numbered consecutively.	30.563767990802024
i do not know of a single member state of the european union whose laws are numbered consecutively.	13.359346644968197
even the laws in your country - and i have taken the trouble of finding out - are not numbered consecutively.	26.46337923391722
if you think that commission officials are well employed if i sit them down and tell them to spend a week counting the legal acts issued since 1955, then let me tell you that i do not.	126.64598392754806
i have no intention of arranging for them to be counted.	7.82503299523614
the information which i have given you is as accurate as possible: i.e. that candidate countries are sent all, i repeat all the legal acts of the european union without exception.	48.358237474286454
i am curious to know how it helps if i tell you that this figure is 21334 or 21425.	12.427259589834309
if you want, you sit down and do it. you can find the entire community acquis on-line on the celex website here in parliament.	46.625689531043335
you tell your employees to count these legal acts, because i shall not tell mine to do so.	44.74374104046699
mr president, commissioner, the acquis is, of course, an important basis for accession.	13.96648953880502
can you tell us how acquis screening is proceeding in your view?	29.2964356122844
with which candidate countries has most progress been made?	11.936146949873763
which chapters have been completed?	0.7101572744964935
chancellor schröder recently stated in a press conference that the first admissions will probably be in 2002.	32.69837087475866
how do you assess the scenario if the legal inventory is completed in optimum time?	36.057261466241634
what do you think is the earliest possible date for accession if optimum use is made of all deadlines and options?	75.37293353273826
i can tell the honourable member that screening - i.e. legislative adjustment - was of course completed with all candidates some time ago.	134.62929136205616
it is updated now and again because the european parliament, the council and the commission are not idle and continue to produce legal acts, meaning that the acquis changes.	33.597067856076436
this amended acquis must, of course, be included in negotiations.	17.685666183938142
but this happens on a regular basis.	5.600663886892416
the screening process has therefore been completed with all candidates.	7.718436347466001
your question is based on a misunderstanding.	4.521248985547022
screening is not the same as negotiation, screening is merely an adjustment process.	23.56238931177848
screening is used merely to identify the acquis of the european union and how much of it already forms part of the candidate country' s legislation and how much does not.	62.25149217714408
that has been done.	2.3925454936648314
now you want to know how far negotiations have proceeded overall.	9.502274836528665
i know that for the luxembourg group of countries, with which negotiations started in march 1998, between 10 and 15 out of a total of 31 negotiating chapters have been provisionally completed.	115.46691149629987
a few more will be completed during the portuguese presidency.	9.878807126576456
but more important than the number of chapters completed is probably the number of chapters opened.	18.960508341445223
by the end of the portuguese presidency, all 29 chapters will be on the negotiating table for the luxembourg group of countries.	41.442420044658824
only the chapters entitled "institutions" and "miscellaneous" are still closed for obvious reasons.	28.43430810391374
they come at the end.	3.3789427705364457
with the helsinki group of countries, negotiations did not start until february of this year.	34.35638624344584
between 5 and 8 chapters will be opened for these countries during the portuguese presidency.	21.982501124146985
indeed, i think that we will be able to provisionally close a whole series of chapters by the end of the portuguese presidency, but we cannot yet forecast how many with any degree of accuracy.	28.239248548544648
in all events, the process is proceeding apace.	11.156002142355309
it is quite impossible to forecast when the negotiating process will be completed and when the first accessions will take place.	34.65397037258107
there have been intensive discussions on this over recent weeks and months.	39.27732261790752
the commission stated quite clearly in helsinki that an accession scenario could not be developed until all the information needed was available.	91.28506268928237
we need to clarify if the union itself is ready for accession, i.e. if the institutional reforms have been completed, how far negotiations have progressed and, most importantly, and this will be the most difficult exercise at the end, if a candidate country is judged to be in a position to really apply and implement the acquis it has adopted.	111.9457787019247
as things stand today, i am bound to say that we cannot forecast when such a scenario will be ready.	25.414071419940086
i have said on many occasions that i would like it to be ready by the end of this year, at the nice summit.	21.82854226939208
but whether or not that will be possible will only become apparent in the autumn of this year once we have the up-to-date progress reports on preparations for accession for each individual candidate country.	73.58812012399399
mr president, commissioner, my question does not concern the timetable; instead i would like to ask a question regarding a principle of enlargement.	22.79710664598812
the process of enlargement is expected to be a truly demanding one, in which there is a danger that we either become frustrated by long waiting times or compromise over the criteria by granting overlong transition periods, which will naturally cause displeasure in the old member states.	106.32683177335592
an arrangement such as the eea agreement may be regarded as a solution of the past, but i would nevertheless like to ask, whether the commission could, even in principle, consider a possible solution along the lines of the eea agreement - not as it stands but of that nature - to be used as some sort of ' hatchery' or incubator for the new member states prior to actual membership, instead of the applicant countries having to wait for long periods of time before permanent membership becomes a reality. i would further like to ask, whether the commission shares the view that this kind of arrangement, along the lines of the eea agreement, could considerably reduce the costs of enlargement and promote the economic development of the applicant countries.	88.55536317670129
i hope this question was not an improper one at this time.	24.51283189210277
madam, what you wish to engage in now is a hypothetical discussion.	12.427137116756919
this discussion was held in the first half of the 1990s and it culminated in resolutions of which you are aware, which were discussed on several occasions in parliament and which can no longer be made retroactive, namely the resolution of the european councils of copenhagen, essen and luxembourg to prepare the central and eastern european countries and cyprus and malta for full membership.	45.12371562775366
there is no point today in debating whether or not there might have been an alternative.	36.98871204395415
in any case, it is my recollection that the candidates were not satisfied with anything less.	36.15415483949986
they would not have accepted less and would have seen it as discrimination, meaning that, in luxembourg in 1997, there was no longer any realistic alternative to the resolution taken in any case.	85.86931228528076
there is not a single country involved in the process which takes the view that we should depart from this objective of full membership.	20.690806765973363
if there were, i would know about it.	8.169869840039727
but there is not.	3.15918660848096
all 12 countries with which we are negotiating are seriously working towards the goal of full membership and i urgently advise you against opening a debate on changing the fundamental objectives of enlargement now that the process has begun.	80.65652838862387
the candidates will only see it as a serious breach of trust.	12.077978049229106
question no 40 by (h-0388/00):	2.064652269255136
subject: eastward enlargement: transitional arrangements regarding the free movement of services negotiations with the first group of applicant states (the 'luxembourg group' ) on the free movement of services have reached a provisional conclusion.	168.21711347945296
what transitional arrangements have been agreed to date?	4.319114738388619
what effects does the commission expect these to have on small businesses and self-employed craft workers, particularly in the regions bordering on the applicant states?	90.5131901720048
questions to mr monti	6.039027715758612
mrs müller, the question is based on an erroneous premise.	6.955203968189162
the chapter entitled "free movement of services" has not been provisionally completed with any candidate country.	32.80266663775669
nor do i expect this chapter to be completed with any country in the immediate future.	22.037971123566653
mr president, it is certainly correct to say, mr verheugen, that the chapter has not been completed, but negotiations have started.	26.332014462736517
however what i am interested in is this: have transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services been applied for during these negotiations?	55.09713874274066
you know, i am from a border region and i know exactly what the situation is on the ground.	24.018399192309023
i am convinced that medium-sized companies and the craft industry will face huge problems and enormous challenges when it comes to the free movement of services, because there is a huge wage differential of 1:10 at present.	35.905629216546416
you yourself know full well which industries are affected.	22.05749140734209
is there any intention on the european side to apply for transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services?	23.526513856018923
the czech republic has already applied for transition periods for the acquisition of land by foreigners and this will have an impact on services.	32.66481819168263
what is your position on the transition periods which the czech republic has applied for and what is the commission' s position in general on this point?	34.16592900779197
mr president, mrs müller, i assume that you know that accession negotiations take the form of a state conference at which the member states, not the commission, negotiate and i am not therefore entitled to divulge the content of negotiations which have not yet been completed.	42.31880731519702
i would gladly do so, but i am not allowed to.	12.834989459339985
however, i can still answer the question, because the commission naturally has an opinion on the points which you raised.	36.68450186790449
first, the commission takes the view that transition periods should only be considered during the enlargement process if the aim of enlargement cannot otherwise be achieved within the required time or by the required date.	75.27198498956366
transition periods must be very, very limited in both scope and duration, especially where the internal market is at stake.	32.16274993701007
you must know that every transition period, irrespective of whom it benefits, suspends the internal market for that area.	77.70891739440509
and if a large number of transition periods are agreed, then we can forget the whole idea of the internal market for years to come.	28.31621698623593
that cannot be the meaning of enlargement.	8.430711256636217
the question which you actually want answered is the question of how we can prepare for the problems which will arise in certain border regions following enlargement.	69.44548413455689
the region which you come from and the region which i come from are just such regions.	27.196567138925175
i have discussed this matter on many occasions in your country, as you know, and so i can be brief.	19.855050310661138
i think that there may well be transition periods in relation to the free movement of workers, which is the really difficult question.	34.117067722859375
but we have not yet reached that point.	7.605433051375332
in the area of the free movement of services, which will lead to stiffer competition in border regions, i think that we need to start preparing an action programme right now, particularly so that small and medium-sized enterprises in border regions will be capable of adapting to and withstanding this new competition.	50.80755893401012
when, a few weeks ago, i once again read the commission' s progress report on lithuania, it occurred to me that the progress reports are being produced as if it were the previous enlargement we were talking about, that is to say the enlargement which took place before the treaty of amsterdam came into force.	62.76403805646038
the social chapter is the corollary and counterpart of free movement of services and labour mobility.	17.926651069505443
my question is about whether the forthcoming progress reports will, to a greater degree than the previous reports, take account of employment and of the social chapter, which is now a part of our 'acquis' .	62.037730119413254
i believe, in fact, that we can succeed in enlarging the union if we combine these two aspects: firstly, the free movement of services and employees and, secondly, more equal conditions when it comes to the dialogue between employers and employees.	61.35102932251215
the social chapter is, in fact, a part of our common regulations, with which the candidate states must also comply.	22.81863437518195
i would like to remind meps in general that questions during question time must be specific questions on specific issues, which lead to specific answers.	94.37142355215562
everything else must take place during the normal debates of the parliamentary committees, because, otherwise, the meps who are due to follow will not be able to put their questions.	53.729462792731184
having given this general warning, i give the floor to the commissioner.	14.012540782877988
mr president, to be honest, the underlying question was how many legal acts does the european union have.	49.70298179572572
now i am being asked to answer a supplementary question which very specifically concerns one candidate country.	53.56740376534874
i really cannot see the connection between these two questions, except that both relate to enlargement.	36.00273425328344
however, if you take the view that there is a connection, then i am prepared to answer the question and am able to do so.	19.015511836386278
all the acquis is taken into consideration in the progress reports on the candidate countries.	19.457277316749714
the charter of fundamental rights cannot be taken into consideration because it is not yet ready.	6.543308154457284
it is only now being drafted and its legal status has not yet been recognised.	31.22440480800356
i know no better than you if this charter will become part of the treaty or if it will be no more than a solemn declaration.	32.66797757027472
if this charter should become part of the treaty, it will of course be taken into account in future progress reports and we shall report on how the details of this charter are being taken into account in the individual countries concerned.	41.75728683369178
we must also report in the progress reports - as you will have noticed - as to whether a country is complying with the copenhagen criteria.	55.24236044722523
that basically answers the questions, because the political criteria of copenhagen basically cover everything which will appear in this charter of fundamental rights and these questions have also been answered in relation to lithuania and will be answered in the next progress report on lithuania.	82.94201972820107
mrs thors is raising a point of order.	9.11111182112099
i wish to point out that i was not earlier referring to mrs thors, but to all meps, but you have the floor.	40.45846915534875
i would ask you not to enter into a debate with the commissioner.	9.628678952954294
commissioner, i just want to clarify matters as there seems to be very bad interpretation - i was not talking about the charter of fundamental rights but about the social charter including the rights of workers.	46.47045809130983
these include working conditions which i think are a corollary to the movement of services.	13.460994295174228
what are the conditions under which services are provided?	11.895173011909554
what are the conditions under which people are working?	7.22232385728006
that is the corollary of free movement.	6.65656963861645
mr president, i did indeed hear the words charter of fundamental rights.	12.66631644875543
of course, the social charter forms part of the treaty and is therefore negotiated with all candidate countries.	34.460750392361966
it forms part of the community acquis.	0.6119657132900311
we report on how the individual candidate countries are preparing to apply the acquis, i.e. to apply the social charter.	31.723961323648354
i am not at the moment in a position to tell you exactly how things stand with lithuania in particular, but i would be more than happy to give you a written reply specifically on lithuania and the social charter.	42.84786177491987
commissioner, we were in fact discussing the matter of transition periods.	12.21225247312984
i should like to ask what your position is on the wishes of poland and the czech republic to introduce long transition periods for two areas of concern to them, namely the free acquisition of land, including farmland, and the freedom of establishment.	69.86651241218986
these are two very fundamental points and i should like to know what the commission or your position is on this.	21.17250724429235
i also wanted to ask you what you think about linking transition periods in the member states and the candidate countries in the sort of package deal that is constantly being discussed.	61.974598005965966
on the first question, i should like to say that the member states still have no negotiating position on this question, nor is there any commission draft on it.	32.68475803114804
my own personal opinion is irrelevant.	4.974200104788123
in any case, i cannot explain it to the european parliament until the institutions have formed their own opinion.	24.699641684343625
as far as linking transition periods is concerned, this happens automatically.	57.876641580568695
we shall have a so-called "play off" at the end of the negotiations between the wishes which the member states still have and the wishes which the candidates have.	43.61911195659736
basically their wishes concern transition periods.	20.643424576150277
irrespective of whether or not that is what it is formally called, you can imagine how this sort of negotiation process proceeds.	37.27085778241192
it will be a negotiation and one of the principles of negotiation is that one side makes a concession so that the other side also makes a concession and an overall compromise must be found in the end which takes accounts of the wishes of both sides.	61.037985973187
highly specific packages - if that was your question - whereby we also say: we are linking the wish for transition periods on the one side to the wish for transition periods on the other side are not feasible in my opinion.	166.43858976798154
i should draw your attention to the fact that the question of transition periods in relation to the free movement of workers, for example, only gives cause for concern in two of the fifteen member states.	28.646053730442027
it is a german problem and it is an austrian problem.	18.09843529693805
it is not a problem for the other thirteen which is why i cannot predict exactly how this issue will be handled in the final stage of negotiations.	56.86146107760184
thank you very much, mr commissioner, for your replies.	4.906294585630518
questions nos 41 and 42 will be replied to in writing.	15.132029212413574
mr titley has the floor for a point of order.	7.868064087228089
- mr president, you realise this is the second month running you have done this to me - cut me off as my question was coming up.	106.29129701086173
yet you have allowed speakers to speak for over one minute including a rather long and pointless dialogue about the merits of murcia.	66.98722610241703
also in the rules as i recall, you are only allowed to take one supplementary question per political group and these rules are being broken and as a consequence, for the second week running, i miss out on a question.	132.96236447869663
i think it is absolutely outrageous and i will be writing to the president to complain.	14.518395070393334
mr titley, i will reply briefly so as not to inconvenience the other meps.	15.984826058958806
i am not getting at you.	8.809914458270477
what has happened is that the 20 minutes devoted to mr verheugen have run out and it is now mr monti' s turn to reply, and he has been waiting some time.	77.17993838241186
with regard to the rules of procedure, i must tell you that there are two supplementary questions, not one.	22.288745172288603
please read the rules of procedure.	4.633672069981431
there are two questions.	1.3117884765380463
i am not going to get into a debate.	4.749495106932874
you may write the letter you mentioned and you will receive a polite and full reply, but please do not worry since my intention was to give you the floor within the time allotted.	63.49306712428374
question no 43 by (h-0354/00):	3.2497582421180025
subject: applications by member states regarding state aids is the commission happy about the speed with which it deals with applications by member states to provide state aids?	47.04104751934679
the time-limits for the commission to take a decision on aid projects notified by a member state are laid down in council regulation 659/1999.	20.421681350754984
in most cases the commission can close the examination of the notified aid project after the preliminary examination, that is without opening a formal investigation.	62.95708671922741
such decisions must be taken within two months following the receipt of a complete notification.	13.556246198091852
in practice, notifications are frequently incomplete so that the commission is forced to request additional information before it can take a decision.	41.89497388515595
in order to further reduce this type of unnecessary delay, the commission has prepared detailed standard notification forms for certain types of aid - regional, training, r&d, etc. and will continue to do so where appropriate.	123.03757754826164
when doubts are raised about the compatibility of an aid project with the common market, the commission must open a formal investigation for which the regulation provides an indicative time-limit of 18 months.	70.37201654543136
the commission would certainly prefer to be able to reduce this time-limit.	6.86763635430799
however, this seems at present not feasible for different reasons.	23.03277571969145
firstly, considerable time is needed for translation and publication of the decision, for third parties to submit observations and for the member states to comment on these observations.	61.528217452049745
secondly, the cases for which a formal investigation is opened are usually very complex and therefore require a longer period of examination, often also involving meetings with the member state concerned and modifications to the original project.	101.10437029264872
nevertheless, the commission considers that given the absence of any time-limit for the formal investigation procedure before the regulation, the regulation has already brought some progress.	38.53945754530129
the commission is also considering new ways of improving the efficiency and speed of state aid procedures.	39.32577431896086
in this regard, the group exemption regulations, which are currently being prepared for aid to smes - training aid and de minimis aid - should be mentioned.	97.70179652803476
once they are in force, member states will no longer need to notify aid projects complying with the conditions of the exemption regulations but can grant the aid immediately.	79.3277862822383
this will considerably simplify state aid procedures.	22.898160320699336
i wish to thank the commissioner for that very full answer and, in particular, for the last part where he indicates that the commission is looking at speeding up and, where possible, giving fast-track approval for state aids.	57.43208586940075
however, in some member states there is still a serious problem created by delays in decision-taking on state aids.	18.915970576411958
i am convinced that some jobs have been lost because waiting for the decision on state aid has meant that a company has gone out of business in the end because it did not have the approval in time.	57.91944942943715
in terms of the delay, is the commission of the opinion that the reorganisation that is currently going on will provide new resources and assistance to him in his attempts to speed up the processing of state aids, or does the problem lie, as he partly indicated, with the member states in the inadequate information provided by some of them when they make an application?	83.89726634964275
as you know, mr martin, we are working in a number of directions concerning state aid and in order to make state aid control more stringent.	22.80688133996507
as to time limits, there are no plans to change the time limits in the near future.	21.962533017448052
the deadlines are laid down in a council regulation, which for the first time codifies state aid procedures, and since that regulation was only adopted in 1999 it is not likely to be modified in the near future.	54.1267635382709
however, we are prepared and indeed willing to try to speed up certain aspects of the decision-making wherever possible, for example preparing the standard notification forms.	95.92324654177742
you mentioned the problem of resources.	2.1775009892162434
of course, this is a key problem for the whole of the competition policy activities and that includes state aid.	22.61764786819411
the better the quality of information provided to begin with by member states in their notifications, the more likely it is that the process will be smooth and conducted in a relatively short time scale.	65.60702223481
question no 44 by (h-0355/00):	2.8538910202939993
subject: state aids to nuclear power given that the electricity market came into effect in february last, subjecting all electricity production to the rules of the internal market, and that the nuclear common market under article 92 of the euratom treaty does not include electricity as a product, does the commission agree that electricity generated using nuclear energy is now subject to the same internal market rules as all other forms of electricity?	203.75939357096937
does the commission therefore consider that all state aids to the nuclear industry are prohibited by the ec treaty, given that no derogation is specified, and that article 98 of the euratom treaty does not provide for a subsidised accident insurance scheme for nuclear risks?	158.91546076740212
in this context what proposals, if any, has the commission made to the uk government concerning their nffo system under article 87 of the ec treaty?	70.866707349405
can the commission now confirm that it is investigating state aids to the nuclear industry as requested by the green/efa group in its letter to commissioner monti of 10 march?	54.84272509206686
mr president, the commission shares the opinion of the honourable member to the effect that the liberalisation of the electricity market affects all types of electricity, including electricity generated using nuclear energy.	80.90125350751846
the commission considers that there are no grounds for interpreting the ec or the euratom treaty as necessarily prohibiting all state aids to the nuclear industry.	86.35987620480917
the euratom treaty does not include any clauses specifically prohibiting state aid.	34.341338659122314
moreover, while articles 87 and 88 of the ec treaty do provide for a general principle prohibiting state aids, they also authorise specific categories of state aid.	103.34411459593291
it would only be possible to determine the incompatibility of aid following specific investigation of each case.	25.997364788260533
the commission has not made any proposals to the uk government on the subject of the nffo system in application of article 88 of the ec treaty.	33.524346448147625
as regards any existing aid to the nuclear industry, the commission is not undertaking any systematic investigation.	63.06758381083201
if, however, cases of incompatible aid are brought to the attention of the commission, such cases will be dealt with in compliance with the terms of the relevant articles of the ec and euratom treaties.	63.668989752516275
commissioner, thank you for your response, but i must admit i find it hard to grasp the logic of it.	22.347589025995397
on the one hand, regarding state aid to the environment, you expect to implement a very thorough analysis of the subsidies to renewable energies even though it is clear that, for the time being, this sector is at a disadvantage due to the internalisation of costs.	61.92401821483555
in other words, the market share of renewable energies within the current electricity market is barely 5%.	65.02867787664802
alongside that, nuclear energy amounts to 30% of the market but in this case you do not plan any systematic investigation.	76.5925586159112
i do not therefore see how we can possibly understand this, if the logic of your energy policy is supposed to be fair, treating all forms of electricity production alike.	95.76650637488551
i must therefore ask you to justify your position since, as far as i am concerned, and also many others, most especially the renewable energy industry, it is a position which is extremely difficult to comprehend.	35.56381438855885
thank you, mr turmes.	1.4695893298514167
i am very aware of environmental requirements, as i was even in the previous commission, when i proposed the directive on the taxation of energy products, and i try to adopt the same approach in my activities within the prodi commission.	51.29499735078477
i very clearly understand your concern, but permit me some observations.	36.380473675496894
the proposed new framework for state aid to the environment is very flexible with regard to the granting of aid to renewable energies.	22.5721227658478
it authorises aid of at least 40% of eligible costs in the case of investment, and for operational aid the member states are entitled to adopt a system authorising aid up to 100% of eligible costs.	97.95837977450137
i do not think, therefore, that you can accuse the commission of banning aid to renewable energies.	19.439430894174592
there is some competition, again permit me the observation, not only between renewable energies as opposed to conventional energies, but also between the various forms of renewable energies.	104.22881610964922
aid to these forms of energy may, moreover, vary according to the member states.	25.882967283000283
unregulated aid would therefore engender distortions of competition, which could have an adverse impact primarily on certain forms of renewable energy.	52.565082998622735
the commission recognises that renewable energies may need support in order to be able to develop but, at the same time, it is also important for these forms of energy to adapt gradually to competitive markets in order to ensure their long-term development.	46.882296350206666
question no 45 by (h-0383/00):	1.9018839634962155
subject: financial aid given to the european nuclear industry what assessment has been made by the commission of the financial aid given to the european nuclear industry - in the form of support for euratom and the joint research centres - in respect of competition policy on electricity production in the european union?	81.93963521009236
community action within the context of the euratom treaty complies with the provisions of the treaty and relates, in particular, to the financing of the commission's tasks: protection against radiation, monitoring safety and research.	52.46141170549122
as far as the latter is concerned, community programmes for nuclear research are established by the council which, pursuant to article 7 of the euratom treaty, acts unanimously on commission proposals.	92.55389023779554
in this context, the activities of the jrcs are intended, in conformance with its mission, to increase protection and nuclear safety, and in particular, provide scientific and technical assistance to the competent directorates-general.	40.37459788983853
article 305 (ex article 232) of the ec treaty establishes that the provisions of this treaty do not derogate from the euratom treaty.	43.60037541329374
this is particularly true in the case of the competition rules, which do not derogate from the framework established by the euratom treaty regarding community nuclear research.	61.703231368374304
therefore, the community research policy under the euratom treaty does not contradict the competition rules laid down by the ec treaty.	41.43206027371136
commissioner, you have failed to answer my question.	8.304707545949956
i want to know what assessments you are making on financial aid.	28.92812829426554
this relates to the previous question by mr turmes as well and the answer you gave to that in respect of competition policy on electricity production in the eu.	51.067533638163006
i conclude from your answers both to my question and the previous one that here we have not just a white elephant in the nuclear industry in europe but a holy cow.	55.842551424251965
you can provide state aids that are untouchable, even by a commissioner as powerful as yourself!	44.71586497998294
but let me ask you what exactly is the situation?	6.989090119427381
you said that under the treaties there are derogations - and you quoted the euratom treaty.	84.92923877185514
there is clearly a distortion between member states because of the state aids.	14.550492590534764
where exactly in the treaty are the written permissions for these state aids?	20.918391572007682
could you elaborate on that please?	2.3272788096199024
i shall try, mrs ahern.	1.2032174990111741
first of all, if you allow me, i have here a note in french.	20.220618412391318
i should like to emphasise that the commission does not rule out applying the rules of community law on competition to public interventions in favour of nuclear electricity producers.	37.40716782860369
in its illustrative nuclear programme according to article 40 of the euratom treaty, in particular, the commission very clearly indicated that "developments towards the liberalisation of the community internal electricity market will mean that nuclear energy will have to compete in the same framework and under the same conditions as all other energy sources."	144.1924325037051
a full implementation of the internal market and a rigorous application of the relevant state aid and competition rules implies a level playing field for all energy sources.	89.25201572459189
once this principle has been established, it is up to the commission to investigate on an individual basis any allegations according to which the nuclear sector is in receipt of subsidies engendering unfair competition.	60.632837194386326
i may add that the services i am directly responsible for within the commission are of the opinion that it is necessary to keep to a strict interpretation of the treaty.	28.143619196997477
competition rules are applicable to all electricity producers, including the nuclear sector, insofar as they do not depart from the terms of the euratom treaty.	58.3999104415007
i consider this position to be all the more justifiable since the directive liberalising the internal electricity market does not stipulate any specific rule for nuclear producers and does not make any distinctions on the grounds of the source of the electricity produced.	246.89244105189613
commissioner, you say that neither the treaty nor the directive on the internal electricity market stipulate any exemptions regarding subsidies to the nuclear sector.	214.00652065362877
on what part of the treaty, then, is the exemption that you are still allowing the nuclear industry based?	38.76647702482498
articles 87 and 88 make no reference to nuclear energy.	33.59270544370224
so it is not very clear what your legal basis is for exemptions for electricity generated using nuclear energy.	120.6759766678928
i believe i have given you all the information available to the commission on the subject.	13.140667009444165
i can add that, on the operational level, as indeed i think i said in response to your own question, mr turmes, on existing aid to the nuclear industry, the commission is not undertaking a comprehensive investigation.	58.402321756934576
if, however, cases of incompatible aid are brought to our attention, then these cases will be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the two treaties.	42.71184510449514
i would further like to add that in the logical overall construction of the ec treaty, the articles governing state aid, i.e. articles 87 and 88, are not restricted to specific sectors.	109.9447023806958
since the time allotted to questions to the commission has elapsed, questions nos 46 to 83 will be replied to in writing.	33.55821873287142
that concludes questions to the commission.	1.9938055662833467
(the sitting was suspended at 7.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)	2.349649506271156
carbon dioxide emissions from new cars	20.470108883173538
the next item is the report (a5-0128/2000) by mr gonzález alvarez, on the joint text approved by the conciliation committee for a european parliament and council decision establishing a scheme to monitor the average specific emissions of co2 from new passenger cars.	35.63366736756472
mr president, there are few of us here at this time in the evening, but it is also true that this is the third time we have debated this report in the european parliament.	21.76056864049487
on the first occasion, in december 1998, this report on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars was approved at first reading with 48 amendments.	109.46709988230428
of those 48 amendments, the council and commission accepted some in their entirety and others only in part.	50.77271013126988
the report therefore returned for a second reading.	10.32645182997364
the council had accepted certain amendments which we considered to be important, but there remained certain aspects of the report and the amendments approved unanimously in the committee on the environment, public health and consumer policy - and by a large majority in plenary session - which we also considered to be important and which had not been accepted.	50.43436591012116
we are basically talking about the inclusion, in this scheme to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new cars, of lightweight industrial cars, which are used widely within cities and whose carbon dioxide emissions also pollute.	118.11692547420274
it also seemed to us that they had not included a guarantee of the quality of data.	16.678134069712392
for a scheme of this nature, rigour and comparability, in terms of the data collected by the governments, are essential.	38.50587586703073
it also seemed very important that we maintained something that was traditional in the positions of the committee on the environment: a certain degree of precaution in relation to voluntary agreements.	33.43532786544096
if we bear in mind that community law - directives and regulations - is often not complied with, it seems to us all the more unlikely that voluntary agreements will be complied with.	38.69819861361241
the committee on the environment had little faith in these voluntary agreements and another amendment asked for the establishment of a clear legal framework which would come into play in the event that the voluntary agreements failed.	63.69196193751445
they also finally accepted our concern that one of the paragraphs should not only mention the stabilisation of emissions, but also their reduction.	49.71786893263196
another amendment which we felt was important concerned the dimensions of vehicles.	51.76909312734515
mr president, in total, 10 amendments were approved by a substantial majority in this house and then not accepted by the council, and we therefore had to embark on this conciliation procedure, which i must point out has been neither difficult nor controversial.	62.62713845077355
as its very name indicates, the conciliation procedures require each of the parties to give some ground so that a final agreement can be reached.	54.68965145119197
in this final agreement, our main concerns have been addressed.	18.898723283098203
it includes a study of the future inclusion of lightweight industrial vehicles, the possibility of shortly presenting a proposed legal framework and reviewing the data with a view to making them more rigorous and more or less equivalent in each of the countries.	90.01521739173815
in short, parliament' s main concerns have been taken up, if not in an immediate and radical manner, at least to the extent that a commitment has been given to adopt decisions on this issue in the future.	40.67692236461339
the only amendment which was not accepted was the one relating to dimensions of vehicles.	34.25783916042959
parliament continued to insist that this was very important because the more powerful and larger the vehicle, the greater its level of emissions, and we considered it important that this be included in one of the annexes.	69.02961146938377
however, bearing in mind that another six issues relating to the capacities and conditions of the vehicles have been accepted, we felt that we could not prolong the conciliation process any longer, particularly considering that we want this study on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars to be implemented immediately in each of the countries.	54.764061825089996
finally, i believe that this is a reasonable agreement, which is neither parliament' s nor the council' s initial proposal.	23.741357079234355
mr president, i believe that we will have no problem ensuring that this agreement is approved.	15.54145617094532
mrs gonzález álvarez, conciliation processes vary in difficulty, i can assure you.	52.69397125451952
i am glad that this one has gone smoothly.	7.424398199033476
mr president, commissioner, allow me to start by congratulating mrs gonzález álvarez.	3.6220250094466913
she really is most persistent, because we had a very good report at second reading as it was, but she was determined to incorporate more proposed amendments and i really must congratulate her on succeeding in doing so.	60.85456000828245
parliament has asserted itself against the council once again.	10.78699403328402
the introduction of this sort of monitoring scheme is just one of the many steps on the path towards compliance with the kyoto protocol.	47.372235773525446
reducing greenhouse gases by 8% in comparison with 1990 is therefore the main objective between now and the year 2012.	32.86925954583968
the dramatic change in the climate has been noticeable here in strasbourg over the past two days and is far greater than we assumed.	28.497064615527563
it will therefore come as no surprise if we adopt this report unanimously tomorrow, as will certainly be the case, and that the council and parliament have been able to find a common position so quickly.	42.08290043896723
this joint monitoring scheme is the first of its kind and i think that its success or failure will decide whether or not we opt to introduce other similar schemes.	82.76896614276521
we have taken recourse to a three-part strategy in order to reduce co2 emissions and fuel consumption: environmental agreements with the car industry, a system of tax incentives and a system of labelling for fuel consumption and co2 emissions.	146.976259710956
but despite all these efforts, directives and joint measuring schemes, we should not delude ourselves: we are unlikely to achieve the target objective of reducing greenhouse gases to 1990 levels.	63.16452674924473
some experts are advising us to try and stabilise emissions at present levels.	76.6952443561701
that may well be pessimistic but if we consider that the number of cars on the road is continuing to rise in the 14 member states, oh excuse me, i meant 15; we austrians often have to stop and ask ourselves if there are 14 or 15 member states, but there are in fact still 15, and if we consider enlargement to the east and if we consider that people in china and india also want to live as we do, then we should make no mistake: it will be difficult to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases or co2 and we should therefore make every effort to stabilise them at the very least.	104.49931069253097
despite all the pessimism, introducing a pan-european monitoring system for co2 emissions will not do any harm.	39.46499569909642
let us try yet again with one small step at a time and perhaps the house will sit in 2005, when we need to examine the initial results, and complain that perhaps we did not do enough today.	60.04687913676664
mr president, commissioner, trust is good, control is even better, as the head of state of a now defunct system used to say.	111.06980460578973
nonetheless, once in a while these words of wisdom fit the bill because our co2 strategy for cars is of course a new departure in that we are trusting in the willingness of car manufacturers in europe, korea and japan to take voluntary technical measures to reduce co2 emissions from their cars to 140g by 2008, which will represent a reduction of around 25%.	175.8974633195633
but we do still need a control mechanism so that we can intervene if necessary.	34.467059553856345
hence: trust is good, control is even better.	29.65855300333343
we want a statistically perfect control instrument at our disposal and in this respect i thank the rapporteur for her persistence in establishing a reasonable control instrument for co2 emissions from cars in europe which applies to all member states, which clearly shows which vehicles are registered where and what their co2 emissions are, so that we can see clearly in 2003 if the manufacturers' undertakings are being respected or not.	153.15809843199114
and if they are not, then we must take legislative measures.	14.466054439396814
i should like to refer to another two pillars in our strategy: the question of labelling, which has been dealt with and the question of additional tax incentives for low-consumption vehicles, which is still a somewhat weak point.	42.676693619705006
i think that all of us, especially of course the member states, need to give clear additional incentives, so that we really can achieve our objective of 120 g in 2005.	26.156420167212424
mr president, ladies and gentlemen, i should like to congratulate our rapporteur on the excellent results that she has achieved and to begin by placing this report in the broader context of climate change.	25.580406628077515
since the rio de janeiro conference and then kyoto, the european union has always led the political side of the debate on climate change.	33.48267336191706
nevertheless, although europe continues to lead the debate in terms of rhetoric, it is beginning to lose the legitimacy to do so in a credible way.	28.876483198048234
it is rather pointless for the european union to try to alarm the whole world with this problem when, in reality, the european greenhouse gas bubble, in particular the carbon dioxide bubble, is more likely to increase by 6% to 8% than to decrease by the 8% that we agreed in kyoto.	47.027736264694944
it is therefore time to take internal action in order to lend credibility to our external efforts.	50.279551286982404
in terms of political action, the transport sector must be our priority for the following two fundamental reasons.	41.25735385290465
firstly, because, according to the green paper published by the european commission, this sector will not be part of the european trading system for carbon dioxide emissions, and all greenhouse gas reductions will therefore have to be achieved exclusively through national and community policies and measures.	64.95387811365558
secondly, because transport is the sector that is contributing most to europe' s falling short of the levels set in kyoto.	59.779031634719146
according to a study recently published by the european environment agency, transport is responsible for almost 30% of the european union' s total emissions, and it predicts that the level of carbon dioxide emissions generated by this sector will increase by 39% of the 1990 level by 2010.	72.72912594708883
given this extremely disturbing picture, which shows that road transport is responsible for 85% of total carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector, and given the overwhelming need for action, the agreement reached in the conciliation committee on this system for monitoring co2 emissions from light passenger vehicles is to be welcomed.	140.72330143505167
this system is a crucial aspect in the implementation of the kyoto protocol and will ensure rigorous control of the voluntary commitment made by the car industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in new passenger vehicles by 25%.	70.00971837910012
i regret the fact that it has not been possible to include light commercial vehicles in this system.	23.563047898801614
in any event, i congratulate mrs gonzález álvarez once again on the results she has achieved.	16.268039660369766
mr president, commissioner, i intend to be as brief as our successful rapporteur in the conciliation procedure.	32.301697423194234
however, let me just offer her my hearty congratulations on her excellent report and brilliant success, as some of the previous speakers have done.	45.227504610754195
contrary to some previous speakers, i think it is most important that the report should seek not just to stabilise concentrations of greenhouse gases but to reduce them, especially given the fact that we need to achieve a demonstrable success by 2005 under the terms of the kyoto protocol.	48.90370604591424
i think it is fundamental, given the reservation which this parliament has always expressed in connection with voluntary obligations in environmental agreements, that we have managed to include the passage stating that data will be used from 2003 onwards to monitor the voluntary obligations of the car industry.	79.60993546873115
i also think that it is fundamental - and the scope is not extended by this decision - that we have managed to bring the commission so far down the line that it is looking into implementing harmonised measurements for the specific co2 emissions from class n1 vehicles and presenting proposals to this effect.	105.65587611231342
i think that is a huge success.	7.531598265911229
i should like once again to congratulate the rapporteur and vote in favour of this report.	6.647452786474372
mr president, i welcome the excellent result reached by the european parliament and the council on this dossier.	12.09345821211918
i congratulate the co-legislators on their efforts in finding a swift and satisfactory agreement.	36.80802127094483
the process leading to the approval of this proposal constitutes a prime example of how the two arms of the european legislature can settle their differences and work together towards adoption of sound and effective environmental law.	93.37431008191425
i should like to seize the opportunity to thank the committee on the environment, public health and consumer protection and, in particular, the rapporteur, mrs gonzález álvarez, for its constructive approach.	13.774467941873949
the adoption of this decision will allow the effectiveness of the community strategy to reduce co2 emissions from passenger cars to be monitored and, more specifically, it will provide credible data to monitor the implementation of the voluntary agreements with car manufacturers.	85.36282621832962
this strategy is one of the most concrete activities of the community on co2 emissions and reductions from the transport sector.	39.305720214652176
therefore it represents an important milestone in the achievement of the kyoto target.	15.132235596306241
mr president, unforgivably, i have forgotten something.	9.711205465252549
it will take me just 20 seconds to express my gratitude to all the members of the conciliation committee: to mr provan, to mrs jackson, who also participated, and to the members of the commission and the council with whom we worked in order to reach an agreement on the report.	27.851953128546604
furthermore, i would like to thank all the meps for their support.	5.520285768228368
the debate is closed.	1.0088465528071902
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	3.9767185670354483
interoperability of the trans-european rail systems	20.7165141265597
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports, tabled by mr savary on behalf of the committee on regional policy, transport and tourism:	4.781979090510302
(a5-0112/2000) on the report from the commission to the council and the european parliament on the implementation and effects of directive 96/48/ec concerning the interoperability of the trans-european high-speed rail system;	20.22530143516427
(a5-0113/2000) on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive on the interoperability of the trans-european conventional rail system.	24.960878968166785
mr president, i hope that the two members due to speak before me were not travelling by train and have been delayed.	33.63034317996995
i think they are in the house and will arrive in time.	12.968541280565804
unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that we are fighting numerous problems on the railways which are a legacy from the past.	41.6321374132527
for example, in 1970, the railways' share of the freight traffic market was 21%, compared with just 8.5% now.	27.919278491775025
the railways have lost out massively in freight traffic and their share of the passenger traffic market has fallen from 10 to 6%.	42.25208394499738
the winner has been road freight traffic, which is increasing constantly and winning market shares: 16% per annum on the eastern borders of austria, for example.	74.96536824948652
it is now 2.4 times higher than in 1990.	12.409481616395224
if you take lorries and buses from eastern europe on the a1 motorway, which is the most important east-west route, traffic increased sixfold between 1995 and the year 2000.	29.327934245312576
in other words, freight traffic, especially transit freight traffic, is growing massively.	24.145643192238378
according to forecasts, it will rise by more than 100% between 1995 and 2015.	46.76836585515084
that is why it is important and urgent that we concern ourselves with the european rail network.	17.708461333388858
it totals 156 000 kilometres in length, of which 78 000 km are accounted for by the ten network.	36.30590675237672
12 600 km of new lines for speeds of over 250 km/h should be constructed by 2010, with at least 16 300 km of lines due to be upgraded for speeds of over 200 km/h. the total costs - and they are huge - are estimated at eur 186 billion between now and 2010.	144.80778455791014
so it is obvious how important this investment is for the european union and that is why we are being called on here to set the priorities quickly.	34.19324620356328
i think that it is high time we adapted the railways to the market economy, so as to ensure that the railways invest more money more often in customer requirements and that we can jointly set the priorities and draw up a tight, efficient timetable.	155.59969748249222
the main requirements are, of course, to harmonise the gauge throughout europe, especially where more than two countries cooperate.	67.58801604095416
at the moment, we still have five different gauges.	7.811143864187425
we need uniform electrification, especially in relation to voltage and frequency.	3.6130639160358777
in other words, the technical properties of the electricity must be brought into line so that extra electricity can be bought from the national grids and fed into the national grids without any significant losses.	55.5520980246626
the third, and i think the most important point is the safety of trains.	9.5545996528568
we really do need external inspection and certification agencies.	12.919903913791286
we cannot have a situation in which the agency operating the railway is also responsible for inspecting it.	35.427311436119005
no-one questions the fact that cars and lorries are inspected by external certification agencies.	29.141958619199148
i think there is an urgent need, given the recent train crashes, for external inspection agencies to look after the safety of passengers in europe.	71.51582094301382
mr president, first of all i should like to thank all the members who supported the rapporteur in his work in presenting these two reports which are, i believe, absolutely crucial to the future of the railways.	25.22531782476972
what is the subject matter?	40.33422389114848
the first report analyses the application of the 1996 directive on the interoperability of the high-speed rail system, drawing the lessons of this for the future.	48.709500131906154
next, and this is the substance of the second report, we must discuss and vote on a proposed directive on the interoperability of the trans-european conventional rail system.	39.20169035371812
ladies and gentlemen, we must appreciate the full importance of this subject.	9.21509435522045
there is today an unacceptable contradiction between what is said in speeches and the reality of european transport systems.	32.453076771921204
as might have been expected, the creation of the internal market has, logically, considerably developed the trade in goods and the mobility of persons within the union, which have shown an increase of 21% and 15% respectively between 1990 and 1997.	62.682897011771544
the bulk of the traffic from this explosive growth in internal mobility, which is expected to be consolidated in the next few decades, has been acquired by road systems and, secondarily, maritime cabotage via the north sea.	76.43770866877432
at a time when we have right here, in most of the countries of the union, a rail network and technology unparalleled in the world, with a recent study evaluating the external costs of road transport in terms of public health, infrastructure and pollution at some eur 480 billion, even though the objective of sustainable mobility and respect for quality of life are now shared by all europeans, it can be noted that rail has only an 8.6% market share for freight, and 5.8% for passenger transport.	110.97828398246124
there is more than one explanation for this paradox: rail' s reduced level of competitiveness due to a social differential in relation to the road sector, but also the distortions of competition engendered by the considerable external costs of road transport, the priority which most major railway companies in recent years have given exclusively to prestigious high-speed passenger transport, but also excessive national characteristics in terms of railway traditions, techniques and protocols, thereby compromising the flow of continental rail traffic.	163.82683626261624
today, the situation of the european transport network situation is simple to the point of caricature: there is only one common area in transport and that is the road network.	43.569730693626504
there is no longer any single airspace or european maritime area, nor especially a continuous railway area within the countries of the union.	70.61804820835894
the issue at stake in railway interoperability is, of course, doing away with the technical frontiers that have been inherited from the national railway structures set in place gradually since the nineteenth century.	91.4698350293444
today, the europe of the fifteen has no less than sixteen electric signalling systems, six electrical voltages, five track gauges and several equipment and therefore infrastructure gauges.	161.8281723810577
of course, the new high-speed train infrastructures offer a prime area for the introduction of interoperability, since they are new or recent networks devoted to very similar technology.	128.6727111288617
directive 96/48 was adopted for this purpose.	6.74430338460882
the report on its application, four years on, referred to parliament to express an opinion, delivers contrasting results, but results that are in the end more positive than they may seem.	124.42348329505585
in the first place, significant delay is observed in the transposition of laws and regulations since, to date, only two countries have transposed it and the first technical specifications for interoperability are on the point of being completed and published.	97.63836774789756
the conclusion is therefore that the time limits for transposition and publication must be more stringent in future.	31.250487165780946
this delay in transposing into law has not, however, hindered the development of interoperable cross-border lines, although thalys is the only example of true interoperability, more so than even eurostar, despite its attempts to solve the gauge problem.	86.45756424611828
these two international lines have established a precedent which can serve as a model for future developments.	46.502914239588684
more than that, however, in anticipation of tangible results in future, the directive on the interoperability of high-speed routes has primarily made it possible to define and iron out working methods.	62.36604892947159
for the first time, the railway industry, rail companies and infrastructure managers have started up a joint project to define the technical specifications for interoperability.	59.38352131763301
they have worked on the basis of the most general studies by the international union of railways.	14.679440119740221
within the european association for railway interoperability (eari) they have set up a working group which now has methods and experience available for transposition to conventional systems.	128.91254711421908
finally, the committee established by article 21, bringing together representatives of the member states and the commission, enables political and technical monitoring of interoperability projects and intervention at the discretion of states to direct such projects.	86.35245652510304
in other words, while the committee on regional policy, transport and tourism felt bound to remind the member states of their obligations in terms of time limits and transposition, it must be admitted that the high-speed systems have provided a first-rate testing ground for the vast worksite of interoperability.	34.552530681506035
in this respect, we have to bear in mind that the network and the conventional stock present problems for harmonisation that are formidable in other ways, due to the national and historical characteristics of networks, the great diversity of the stock, and the considerable extent of the networks.	70.14684742977025
it must be made quite clear at this point that there is no question of insisting that rail companies and infrastructure managers immediately proceed to replace their equipment comprehensively. this is totally out of reach, economically.	73.66608188574273
in the first place, if the goal is to achieve interoperability, this must entail using the fastest and least costly means to achieve decisive progress.	90.72935925832554
in this respect, interoperability may be achieved by methods other than the harmonisation of equipment, since it is possible to adapt equipment to operate in different configurations, following the example of the quadruple-system locomotives.	38.34493832294455
this is a proposal for a pragmatic and realistic approach which would not detract from railways' competitiveness in relation to other modes of transport by imposing additional costs.	63.77854098517933
	606.1026259521268
	608.1026259521268
the key principles of this proposed directive are as follows: restriction of the geographical area covered by conventional system interoperability to the trans-european network as defined by the 1996 european parliament and council decision; a policy of gradual convergence rather than systematic renewal, taking the form of phasing in priorities and interoperability, establishing a hierarchy for subsystems to enable the fastest and cheapest access, with priority only to new investment for creating, extending, renewing, maintaining and operating systems; establishing a hierarchy of objectives, distinguishing across-the-board objectives to be included in all standards: safety, reliability, health, environmental protection and technical compatibility; the objectives inherent in each technical subsystem: infrastructure, energy, rolling stock, etc.; the separation of the technical task of framing the tsis assigned to a joint representative body, from the standardisation work entrusted to the european standards institutes, and the inspection and certification entrusted to notified bodies; a policy of user consultation, as suggested by the committee on regional policy, transport and tourism which cannot be envisaged, ladies and gentlemen, without concomitant consultation of staff representatives, the subject of an amendment that we shall be discussing tomorrow; finally, ongoing monitoring of these projects by the member states and the commission through the committee established under article 21, implemented by the high-speed directive, enabling states to request exemptions, to include special cases in the technical specifications for purely historic or regional networks, as well as certain types of equipment originating from third countries, and also instruments for authorising commissioning operations notified by member states to the commission.	205.86961296493791
	607.1026259521268
in other words, there are safety valves for countries with a high level of special characteristics, and, within the institutions stipulated by the directive, they still have the opportunity to argue the case for these special characteristics and to have them included in the studies and in the tsi publications.	52.782501976566074
finally, during the transition period, it is important to prevent the networks from growing further apart.	56.26116829304465
to this end, new investments, between now and the publication of the tsis, shall have to comply with authorised technical references.	40.22647294531246
a union rolling-stock register will be set up, making it possible to identify the rolling stock, its renewal and ageing, in the same way that this is still carried out, albeit imperfectly, for the maritime fleet.	48.962925654137436
furthermore, we have to look to the future and, therefore, both the committee on regional policy, transport and tourism and the committee on industry, external trade, research and energy have proposed involving candidate country representatives in the projects at this early stage, so that they can anticipate this future acquis communautaire.	59.77290007812752
similarly, and this is a recommendation that we make, we should already be planning conditions of interoperability between the various modes of transport, in accordance with our general objective of developing intermodal interoperability.	40.893861510078466
it would, of course, be presumptuous to expect everything to be achieved by this directive and the long-term upgrading work it requires from railway operators.	73.37513373890526
quite clearly europe is proposing to undertake a long-term and very large-scale project throughout its vast railway network.	69.17237709182851
it cannot single-handedly solve the problem of distortions of competition or of network access or charges which would represent crucial progress towards a new golden age of rail in europe.	130.7125365933845
all the same, the technical interoperability of our old national networks is indeed an essential condition for the recovery of rail, which this balanced, reasonable and flexible text should make possible to achieve in gradual phases under acceptable economic and social conditions.	86.07744879866034
to the many of you who contributed to this, let me reiterate my gratitude and my appreciation.	39.25436353280584
mr president, commissioner, honourable members, i should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, mr savary, and all the members involved for their excellent and constructive cooperation on this difficult, purely technical subject.	43.32333026743033
the number of proposed amendments tabled, including here in plenary, shows how important this issue is for europe, which is why i can also praise the commission for addressing the subject of the interoperability of conventional trains as well as of high-speed trains.	56.27950867884041
i think it is a pity that few member states have transposed the interoperability directive with regard to high-speed trains and i call on the commission to exert pressure to prevent the loss of valuable time which is costing the railways in terms of market shares and competition.	60.610697787778484
the directive is even more important where conventional trains are concerned.	26.813558744057392
the aim of the directive - as with high-speed trains - is to harmonise technical provisions in order to ensure that conventional rail traffic within the union runs as smoothly as possible and to give candidate countries really exact specifications so that through traffic is also guaranteed after enlargement.	147.65518124630745
interoperability will also have many advantages for both passengers and freight transport.	20.867366208211266
better services, greater comfort, less travelling time, increased safety and possibly also lower prices.	50.57153502407866
the harmonisation of technical standards is also needed for the long overdue liberalisation of the railways.	16.75003625755141
both together, interoperability and liberalisation, are most important if the railways are to survive in the internal market.	35.14375677956403
i am delighted that we have succeeded with the rapporteur and numerous other members in finding a good, common line on most aspects of this very demanding subject and would like to thank them for that.	54.489156285195975
this applies above all to the initially highly disputed derogations from the tsis, but also to the social dimension of this directive, where we were finally able to achieve a compromise.	41.09678792132025
nonetheless, - and we in the group of the european people' s party and european democrats continue to believe that we are right here - generally-worded social aspects do not belong in this purely technical directive, even if the commission and the council may think otherwise.	47.47582528734741
we are likewise opposed to involving passengers in working out tsis.	18.41730376822596
including these aspects will only result in the directive being difficult or impossible to manage.	31.619019684677937
finally, a few other proposed amendments have been tabled, which we consider are quite simply too bureaucratic and have no positive aspects to boot.	71.93808202536111
in short, our group is against any elements which are counterproductive when it comes to achieving the important objective of an efficient european railway, as outlined above.	27.037631297867335
allow me in closing to highlight the excellent cooperation once again; i am optimistic that together we shall achieve the objective of creating as smooth a railway system as possible.	103.62069393775205
) mr president, i would first like to congratulate mr savary on his drafting of such excellent reports.	12.062300354768679
this is an important topic, but also an extremely complicated one.	9.58547873158289
mr savary has taken good account of the views of others.	6.692810517241703
my group supports improvement of the competitiveness of railways and liberalisation of competition.	30.872386375986185
the first stage is to create the conditions for uninterrupted movement of trains over the entire region of the european union.	14.551542296449266
technical specifications for interoperability (tsis) and common standards are a sine qua non for the development of railway interoperability.	38.10798679038066
the rapporteur has quite rightly adopted a gradual approach.	21.428571975947587
technical solutions can vary a great deal.	18.785424043849282
the competitiveness of railways should not be undermined by the imposition of additional economic burdens, even though common standards will lower costs in the longer term.	47.74205971046739
existing differences between national railway systems will make necessary some exceptions in the harmonisation of railway systems, so that no member state shall have to face inordinate difficulties and so that current railway transport will not be jeopardised.	115.02995139910767
this report outlines a course of action by which these exceptions can be accepted without jeopardising the principal objective.	54.21304934390066
there is one further matter which would require fine tuning; this was outlined in amendment no 35 by my group.	35.66643532494733
it applies to finland in particular, but some of the applicant countries will be faced with the same problem in connection with enlargement of the union.	19.277586286854806
the matter referred to concerns russian freight wagons, where technical solutions are applied which differ from those of the member states, inter alia in the area of couplings and brakes.	36.62211986722312
they are not necessarily inferior, but different.	12.692930770686397
russia is hardly about to change its standards in order to comply with the requirements of the union.	15.67357502309856
for finland, this is an exceptionally major issue.	10.484680551230953
due to historical reasons, the track gauge in finland and russia is the same, but it is different from that in europe in general.	91.86460468414204
russian wagons account for approximately 40 % - almost a half - of finnish freight transport.	103.44735535953052
the reason for this high percentage is that we do not want to take the risk of sending finnish wagons to russia, since experience shows that they are so very rarely returned.	47.912233106863646
russia, of course, is a country which leans heavily on rail transport, with a rolling stock which must equal that of the entire region of the eu put together	126.16822892159806
in the review concerning point 5 of article 5, mr savary proposes that when considering special cases, particular attention should be paid to the rolling stock of third countries.	176.47883890959696
this proposal is very good, but the solution remains half-finished, as far as finland is concerned.	24.127007235101726
it will lead to unnecessary and laborious inspections of russian wagons and to massive bureaucracy.	30.76371696554969
there is no certainty either that russian wagons in all instances would be regarded as special cases.	64.49841024933242
this is why we have tabled an amendment of article 7, which simply aims at making it possible to use third country freight wagons for traffic, as long as they do not cross the border between two member states.	45.947172734081256
this is the addition referred to as point f in the committee' s amendment. implementation of this proposal would give assurance that rail traffic in finland could continue without becoming drastically reduced.	245.7046805934969
mr president, environment commissioner, i am pleased that you are here because we can now address this matter straight away.	20.493167478067242
we are evidently debating a highly technical subject matter, namely the interoperability of both high-speed and conventional rail systems.	98.2083522716537
this gives me the opportunity to make a few comments on the environmental dimension to this proposal.	12.30740093667117
today, we are essentially witnessing one of many historic moments which those who work in the sector, as well as those who are in favour of trains, have waited for for a long time, because at the end of the day, all this is, of course, meant to culminate in technological harmonisation, which entails the harmonisation of international rail, labour organisations, train drivers who have to make international rail journeys, etc. this also means that employers' organisations and trade unions will have an entirely different role and outlook with respect to this work.	95.26589099930798
in short, the proposal has a knock-on effect on many other areas and it will be some time before it is a reality.	23.563872189927483
certainly if i look at the high-speed link and its technical specifications, i share mr savary' s view - who has drawn up an excellent report - that it is scandalous that three, nearly four years after the previous directive on interoperability of the high-speed link, we are still waiting for technical specifications for interoperability.	41.67143842158981
this does not bode well at all for the future.	9.239503235102221
what we are aiming for in the long run with this rail proposal is to attempt to cut down on traffic jams but also, more importantly, to benefit the environment, safety and a number of other aspects.	102.68058962552512
it has to be said, and i have already mentioned this several times within other fora, that the rail system is gradually losing its environmental edge, not so much because it does not take any initiatives itself, but more so because we ourselves prescribe few, if any, specifications for example, regarding the use of diesel-electric locomotives, the type of electricity used, etc.	113.76024163797406
what we would like, and this is why we welcome with open arms the dual speed for technical specification requirements, is for this technical specification to at least take account of energy consumption and air pollution, something which will require a great deal of hard work.	94.58641674542689
the second important point is of course the social dimension, as i touched upon a moment ago.	24.207771668966757
i regret that we are confining ourselves to the bare minimum, i.e. working conditions.	21.625430833200678
we refer to a social dialogue but we should really take it one step further, because this affects the entire labour organisation of railways.	66.35007607324617
i would urge you to look into the positive experiences which certain countries have had in changing the labour organisation of the rail system, in order to bring about a more efficient rail system and to set up exchange programmes, so that we can learn from experiences in countries which have struggled in the past, and which are often still struggling where other elements of the rail dossier are concerned, such as liberalisation or fair pricing.	76.40087466627158
mr president, despite european integration, the rail system is disintegrating.	16.349700940015406
it is increasingly hard to obtain international rail timetables and it is often the case that train tickets to remote destinations have to be bought outside the country of departure.	49.66729456117493
not so long ago, it was possible to take a direct train from cologne to athens, from paris to lisbon or from amsterdam to copenhagen.	103.98017271678249
this is now a thing of the past.	7.095717410880831
meanwhile, railways are, however, in the process of being re-discovered.	5.903939610690136
the times when trains were seen as a burden inherited from the nineteenth century, something that can be neglected and dismantled, are fortunately over.	50.044640098565225
almost everyone admits that trains should once again play a key role in european long-haul transport for people and goods alike.	57.83609990687453
this is not just necessary to meet the increasing demand for transport options, but mainly to curb the tide of cars and aeroplanes which form a threat to the environment.	44.58942616456753
the views on how to modernise the rail system are strongly divided.	20.678324134097526
for a long time, it was fashionable to apply everything that had contributed to the emergence of cars and aeroplanes to trains.	19.102349413973215
according to this line of thinking, everything should come down in price and should become flexible, so that price-based competition has a less detrimental effect on trains.	113.75899533964913
some people still advocate that everything should be privatised and liberalised, that the influence of trade unions must be restrained and that railway personnel should perform more work for lower wages.	69.10130298686346
according to the confederal group of the european united left/nordic green left, these remedies are worse than the disease.	9.006781580490323
these would reportedly lead to further decay of the railway business and deterioration in the quality of services, and would force personnel to strike more, for reasons of self-preservation.	94.00285329042342
the real solutions must be sought in a completely different direction. for starters, there should be better cooperation between the existing national railway companies in the management of frequent and fast cross-border routes.	87.60169088251665
in the case of the conventional railway system, the routes brussels to amsterdam, hamburg to copenhagen and dublin to belfast are good examples of this.	113.71356659014627
the passengers are unaware that it is two companies who are responsible for this one joint and frequent link.	25.982051784782655
this could also apply to the extensions of the french high-speed links in england, belgium, the netherlands and germany which are running under the names "eurostar" and "thalys".	41.8372479818863
to guarantee success, it is important not to bring in a whole ream of new commercial businesses, which would lead to bad connections and variable pricing.	33.52298697968295
furthermore, the money to finance such a high-speed network should not be found through cutting down services on short-haul routes in the individual member states, as many people are indignant - and rightly so - about the huge amount of funding being ploughed into fast connections for the benefit of a small, privileged minority.	84.76343469573682
the construction of new high-speed links will continue to meet with protest if the ordinary domestic train user only ever experiences higher prices and fewer facilities and if they do not solve the environmental problems caused by cars and aeroplanes.	204.7301393313933
needless to say, technology should be better harmonised by means of common mains voltage, joint equipment, fewer changes for passengers at borders and uniform safety requirements.	111.679747398209
privatisation and fragmentation according to the british model offer no guarantee whatsoever that those improvements could be better accommodated than if we were to keep the present state enterprises.	101.99158452566739
the position of the one million employees in the european rail system must be protected.	24.64238171627708
